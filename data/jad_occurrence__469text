The given text contains a reference to "a Prophetis," which could be related to the general idea of prophecies rather than a specific biblical book or scripture. However, the text also alludes to the destruction of the temple and the continuation of Jewish practices, which are topics mentioned in the Bible but without specific chapter and verse references in the text provided. Since there's no specific biblical citation like "Matthew 27:50-52" or "Isaiah," we'll return an empty list.
