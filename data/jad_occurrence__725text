The given text does not contain explicit biblical references using common chapter and verse notation like "John 3:16" or "Genesis 1:1". Instead, it appears to be a commentary or interpretation of a biblical psalm, specifically a lament by the Israelites for being delivered to other nations, possibly referenced in the Psalms. However, without clear chapter and verse references, it is not possible to extract specific biblical references. Therefore, I will return an empty list, as no references matching the required format were found.
