To find potential biblical references in your text, we will analyze the content for phrases or themes that are reminiscent of specific biblical passages. Let's break down the text:

1. "et omnia sunt parata, quia introitus regni apertus" - This could reference the theme of readiness for the kingdom of heaven found in the Parable of the Wedding Banquet (Matthew 22:1-14) where guests are invited to a prepared feast. 

2. "in villam ire est labori terreno in moderate incumbere" - This could refer to the general theme of avoiding being consumed by earthly concerns, akin to advice found in the teachings of Jesus, especially about where to lay one's treasures (Matthew 6:19-21).

3. "negociari vero, terrenis lucris inhiare" - This might relate to the caution against pursuing worldly wealth over spiritual wealth (Matthew 6:24-34).

4. "hi sunt pauperes et gentiles qui postea congregati sunt ad nuptias, id est ad fidem convenerunt" - Again reflects the Parable of the Wedding Banquet (Matthew 22:1-14), where those initially invited to the wedding feast do not come, and others are brought in instead.

These lines suggest themes rather than direct citations, but based on your request to identify specific similarities, I've assembled the biblical references:
