The text does not contain any explicit biblical references by book, chapter, and verse in the format you're requesting (e.g., "Matthew 27:50-52"). The content discusses historical and religious events but does not cite specific biblical passages. Therefore, the returned JSON will be an empty list, as there are no direct biblical references to extract from the text.
