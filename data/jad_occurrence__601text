The input text appears to not contain explicit biblical references in the form you are asking (such as "Matthew 27:50-52"). The text seems to be a historical account rather than a direct excerpt from the Bible, and it does not mention specific books, chapters, or verses from the Bible. Therefore, the result would be an empty list.
