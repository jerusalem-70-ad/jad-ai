The given text appears to contain several allusions to biblical events and figures but does not contain direct citations or specific references to scripture passages that can be identified with chapter and verse numbers. We typically identify biblical references by direct quotes or citations. However, the text mentions historical events and figures related to biblical narratives, such as the ascension of Christ and the death of James, which are drawn from biblical accounts, but it doesn't specify them in a way that can be formatted as direct biblical references with chapter and verse.

As such, the result will be an empty list, as there are no direct biblical references identifiable in the specified format:
