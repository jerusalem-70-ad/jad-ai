Upon reviewing the given text, there are no explicit biblical references such as specific books, chapters, or verses from the Bible cited directly by name (e.g., Genesis 1:1). The text seems to be a theological or allegorical discussion that references biblical events or concepts, such as the plagues of Egypt or the Roman persecution of Christians, but it does not specify these in the format of book, chapter, and verse from the Bible.

Therefore, the result would be an empty list:
