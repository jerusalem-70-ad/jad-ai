The text provided does not contain explicit biblical references with chapter and verse numbers, such as those found in standard translations of the Bible. Instead, it discusses historical events and figures, such as Pontius Pilate, in a narrative form. As such, there are no specific biblical references such as "Matthew 27:50-52" or similar that can be extracted from this text.

Therefore, the result is an empty list, as there are no direct biblical citations to identify.
