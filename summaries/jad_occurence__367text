The text criticizes those who refuse to convert, particularly the Jews who, despite their prayers, do not receive salvation as they do not pray through the Mediator, Jesus Christ. It foretells that those who reject Christ will face consequences in the future. Finally, it concludes with a note on God's refusal to hear those who do not acknowledge Him through Christ.",
