  "summary": "The text is a metaphorical interpretation by the Prophet using the harvest or vineyard to represent the Israelite people. The 'women' mentioned are symbolically referring to the synagogues of various nations such as Egyptians and Philistines. After Jerusalem's destruction by the Romans, these women, symbolizing the educated Jewish women from various regions, who once came to teach the people how to defend against enemies, were struck with grief and despair, not because of the Lord's passion, but due to the downfall of such a great city. The text reflects on the shame felt during this period, as women took on the role of teaching in the absence of men during the Roman and possibly Babylonian invasions.",
