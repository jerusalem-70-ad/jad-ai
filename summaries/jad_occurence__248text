  "summary": "The text is a religious reflection on the punishment and dispersion of the enemies of the Church, specifically focusing on the Jewish people before the destruction of Jerusalem. It describes how a few converted Jews were forewarned by the Holy Spirit to leave the city to avoid perishing with the wicked.
