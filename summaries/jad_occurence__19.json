  "summary": "The text discusses the allegorical interpretation of the biblical figures Christ and Elisha. Christ is seen as the head of the entire Church, with His apostles and faithful followers as its teachings. During His passion, Christ was abandoned by His disciples, symbolized as being 'bald.' Elisha, whose name is interpreted as 'salvation of the Lord,' foreshadowed Christ, who was to bring salvation to the world. The mocking of Elisha by children as he ascended the mountain is paralleled with Christ being mocked by the Jews during His crucifixion. Elishaâ€™s cursing of the children, resulting in bears attacking them, is likened to the Roman generals Vespasian and Titus attacking the Jews after Christ's ascension.",
