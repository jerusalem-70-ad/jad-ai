  "summary": "The text discusses the patience of the Savior regarding the persecutions he faced from his people, leading up to the crucifixion. It reflects on how God was not patient after these events, emphasizing the swift divine response from the time of Christ's passion to the fall of Jerusalem, which took place over 42 years. This was a period allowed for repentance for those who would believe through the apostles' signs. The passage also contemplates the suffering from the contempt of sinners and the plea for God's aid, relating this to the eventual destruction of Jerusalem and the people after Christ's passion. The text connects this with a prophetic perspective and the ultimate culmination of divine words into joy despite present sufferings.",
