  "summary": "After the ascension of Christ, who was mocked by the Jews while crucified, a curse pronounced against them is said to have taken effect, as foretold by Jesus to the daughters of Jerusalem. He warned of the times when people would desire the mountains and hills to cover them, implying dire consequences. Following this curse, Vespasian and Titus emerged, ravaging the Jewish nation. They besieged the city, causing death by starvation, killed captives, and sent others into exile, ensuring no resurgence of the Jewish kingdom. The text connects this with the Israelites' trials in the desert, and uses biblical numerology to symbolize the struggles of the faithful during these tribulations.",
