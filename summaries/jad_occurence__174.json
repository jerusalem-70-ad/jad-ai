  "summary": "The text discusses the desire of the wicked to destroy the holy people of God, both spiritually and physically, comparing it to devouring bread. It references a biblical account involving the Jews who conspired against Jesus, fearing that the Romans would take their place and nation if they let Him continue. This connects to the idea of confounding the counsel of the poor, with a reference to Jesus, who became poor for humanity despite being rich. The passage highlights the contrast between human fear and divine protection.",
