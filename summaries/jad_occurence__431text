  "summary": "The destruction of Jerusalem was delayed for forty years after the crucifixion of Christ, occurring in the second year of Emperor Vespasian's reign. This period allowed Jews the opportunity, if they were willing, to repent, as they were frequently warned by the apostles about the impending devastation. James, the brother of the Lord, also educated them on this forthcoming event through signs and celestial omens seen before the fall of the city. A bright star resembling a sword was observed over the city, and a comet was seen burning with ominous flames throughout the year.",
