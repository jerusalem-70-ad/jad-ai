  "summary": "During the Jewish-Roman War, Jewish historian Josephus, who gained favor with Emperor Vespasian due to his prophecy regarding the empire, writes that 1.1 million Jews died by sword and famine, with the survivors dispersed globally. Emperors Vespasian and his son Titus celebrated a grand triumph over the Jews in what was considered a unique spectacle among 320 triumphs since Rome's founding, as father and son were celebrated together in one triumphant chariot. Following this, they declared peace throughout the Roman Empire and closed the Temple of Janus, symbolizing the end of war.",
