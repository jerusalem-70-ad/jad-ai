  "summary": "The text discusses the concept of divine anger and vengeance from a theological standpoint, emphasizing that God's wrath is not literal but is communicated in human terms. It likens God's actions to those of a calm king who appears wrathful to those he punishes. It highlights the distinction between 'furor' (a sudden agitation of the mind) and 'ira' (anger that persists), noting that neither applies to God. The text reflects on how God demonstrates His power through vengeance, overcoming demons and Jews, similar to how a king would assert control. It also references the crucifixion of Christ, where the blood of Christ is attributed as recompense for demonic influences and the Jews' role in his death. The passage also alludes to biblical references concerning betrayal and divine retribution.",
