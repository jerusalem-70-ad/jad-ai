  "summary": "Daniel laments the absence of leaders, prophets, sacrifices, and incense in the present time, making it difficult to find mercy. This is related to the final days, as it is understood among his contemporaries. During the time under the Chaldeans, Daniel and Ezekiel began prophesying, along with other prophets. Later, during the era of Titus and Vespasian, all notable figures were taken from Judah, indicating a loss of support symbolized by 'SAMECH,' which means assistance. As prophesized by Isaiah, Jerusalem lost its strong men, leaders, and wise individuals, representing a complete withdrawal of aid.",
