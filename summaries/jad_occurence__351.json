  "summary": "The text discusses the interpretation of Jesus Christ's death as a sacrifice beneficial for humanity, not just the Jewish people but for all predestined children of God dispersed around the world. It contrasts this profound truth with the superficial reasoning that Jesus' death would prevent Roman retribution against the Jews for their belief in Him as their king. The text suggests that this greater truth was divinely revealed, rather than understood by the speaker, and notes the evangelical and ecclesiastical recognition of this prophecy. The passage highlights the divine influence on prophecy and the acknowledgement of Christ's redemptive sacrifice by the Church.",
