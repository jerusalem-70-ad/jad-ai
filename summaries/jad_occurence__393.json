  "summary": "The passage discusses the strife within the Jewish community during the conflict between Antiochus and Ptolemaic leaders. Some supported Antiochus while others sided with Ptolemy. A Jewish priest, Onias, fled with many Jews to Egypt, where he was welcomed by Ptolemy and allowed to build a temple similar to the Jewish temple, which lasted until the reign of Vespasian. The Jewish city, Oniae, was later destroyed during conflicts with the Romans, leaving no trace. This event led to a large number of Jews seeking refuge in Egypt and Cyrenaica. Onias claimed to fulfill a prophecy from Isaiah, asserting that he was establishing an altar to the Lord in Egypt, which was controversial as it was outside of the prescribed location for sacrifices according to Jewish law.",
