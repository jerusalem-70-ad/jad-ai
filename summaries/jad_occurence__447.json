  "summary": "The text describes a divine command for the prophet to deliver a message to the people, indicating that they will hear and see without understanding due to their spiritual blindness and forgetfulness of their Creator. The prophet questions how long this judgment will last, and God replies that it will continue until the cities of Judea are completely overthrown by Vespasian and Titus, leading to the scattering and dispersion of the Jewish people globally. A significant reduction in the Jewish population will occur, and when Emperor Hadrian comes around fifty years later, he will fully plunder the land, indicating a total devastation comparable to a terebinth or an oak that has lost its acorns.",
