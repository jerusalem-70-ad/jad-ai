I'm sorry, but I do not have access to the specific text you're referencing, "de subversione qua fecerunt Tytus et Vespasianus, cum romano exercitu," so I'm unable to provide a detailed summary. However, based on the title and context, I can provide a general summary and keywords based on related historical events.

{
  "summary": "The text likely discusses the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman generals Titus and Vespasian. This event marks the end of the Jewish revolt against Roman rule and results in significant destruction and loss of life, including the demolition of the Second Temple in 70 AD.",
  "keywords": ["Vengeance", "Temple", "Prolonged siege", "Discussions Roman Empire"]
}
