  "summary": "Vespasian, after capturing many Jewish towns and besieging Jerusalem where Jews had gathered for a festival, was informed of Nero's death and assumed the Roman Empire with the encouragement of many. Leaving his son Titus to continue the siege, Vespasian stayed briefly in Alexandria. Titus, enduring a prolonged siege and substantial casualties, eventually breached the city's walls. The inner temple's defenses, held by priests and leaders, required further effort to conquer. Proclaimed emperor by the army, Titus burned and destroyed the Jerusalem Temple, which had stood for over a millennium. The destruction accounted for hundreds of thousands of Jewish deaths, with many more sold into slavery and dispersed globally.",
