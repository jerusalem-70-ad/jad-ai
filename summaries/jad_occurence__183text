  "summary": "The text discusses a prophecy of desolation and destruction, using metaphors like a vineyard being ravaged. It suggests a future forsaking of the once beautiful city, referenced in Ezekiel, where the Roman army (referred to metaphorically as a wild boar) would graze and lay waste to it. The barren fate is attributed to the rejection of the 'good shepherd', leaving them vulnerable to wild beasts. This presents an apocalyptic vision of divine judgment and abandonment.",
