  "summary": "The text discusses how the city once called its own nest, Jerusalem, is now referred to as the house of the Jews, abandoned and left desolate by divine assistance due to their rejection of Christ. It notes the betrayal where Christ is handed over to Herod and Pilate, likening them to foxes. Following Christ's crucifixion, the Romans came and destroyed the city, akin to a nest being plundered. The passage also references Christ's future return in glory, when he will be acknowledged with the blessing, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,' highlighting an eschatological aspect. This comes after Christ was previously praised entering Jerusalem, and is meant to be understood mystically.",
