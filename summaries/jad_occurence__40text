{"summary":"The text discusses the story of Elisha (Elisaeus) who is mocked by Jews as he ascended, similar to how Christ was mocked when he was going to be crucified at Calvary. After Christ ascended to the heavens, two bears from the forests, representing Vespasian and Titus, were sent to destroy the Jews brutally. This destruction took place where the Jews had crucified the Lord, symbolizing divine vengeance.","keywords":["Anti-Judaism","Vengeance","Typology"]}
