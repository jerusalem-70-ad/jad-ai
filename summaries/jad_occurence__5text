  "summary": "The text discusses the intrinsic and extrinsic material and intention present in all prophets. It refers to the vision of the prophet Zechariah who saw four horns representing four kingdoms—Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, and Romans—that destroyed the Jews. These are countered by four craftsmen symbolizing prophets who predicted these kingdoms' destruction, as exemplified by Jeremiah's mission to uproot and destroy nations and kingdoms, and also to build and plant. Spiritually, the four horns signify four types of sins affecting the Jews.",
