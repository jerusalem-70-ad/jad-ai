  "summary": "The text is an allegorical reflection by Asaph, who marvels at God for allowing the Jewish people, symbolized as a vineyard, to be exposed and ravaged. It describes how God removed the protective barrier, leading to devastation by outsiders symbolized as wild beasts. The reference to Christ as the 'true way' and the destruction by Vespasian and Titus suggests a spiritual and historical interpretation. The text also draws a parallel to the Church, highlighting the martyrdom of saints as a form of spiritual demolition. The wild boar represents those who, lacking divine insight, destroy and pollute the sacred. This could potentially be linked to historical events of divine vengeance or spiritual warfare.",
