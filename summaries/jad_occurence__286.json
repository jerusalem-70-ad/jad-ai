  "summary": "The king sent his armies to defeat the murderers and set their city on fire. This destruction was seen as divine vengeance for past sins against God. When Roman leaders demolished Jerusalem, which was sanctified by the blood of Christ and other saints, they killed its legitimate inhabitants. The Church was rebuilt, symbolizing the Heavenly Jerusalem prepared by God. The Lamb of God gathered people of all ages to Him.",
