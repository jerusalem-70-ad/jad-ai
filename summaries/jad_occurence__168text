  "summary": "The text refers to the destruction and downfall of Jerusalem and its inhabitants, symbolized by the 'cedars of Lebanon'. Once a noble city filled with rich and powerful people, it was significantly damaged during the time of Titus and Vespasian. The city's capture led to its burning and the miserable death or enslavement of its people. The destruction is likened to a bull being sacrificed, chopped into pieces and then set on fire, as described in the books of Exodus and Leviticus.",
