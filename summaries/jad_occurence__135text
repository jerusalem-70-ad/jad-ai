  "summary": "The text describes a lavish meal hosted by Vitellius for his brother, which included two thousand fish and seven thousand birds. Meanwhile, Vespasian was besieging Jerusalem when he was declared emperor by his soldiers upon hearing of Nero's death. Vitellius, in response, killed Vespasian's brother Sabinus and many others by setting Capitol on fire. Vespasian's forces ultimately defeated Vitellius in a battle near the city walls. Vitellius was captured, humiliated, and paraded through the forum with his hands bound, after which he was executed and his body was thrown into the Tiber River at the age of 57, eight months into his reign.",
