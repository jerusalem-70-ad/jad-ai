  "summary": "The text reflects on how, during the crucifixion of Christ, celestial events such as an earthquake and darkening sky symbolized God's call to the Roman Empire to avenge Christ's unjust death. The author marvels at the notion of a crucified man, seemingly abandoned, having such an influential army at his command. This serves as a metaphorical demonstration of Christ's divine justice and the ultimate power of his word, calling upon 'many strong armies' to fulfill His will.",
