  "summary": "The text argues against the leaders, priests, and prophets of Judah, stating that because of their actions, Zion will be plowed like a field and Jerusalem will become a pile of stones. This desolation is predicted to mirror the destruction that occurred under the Romans, as they ravaged the city for striking the cheek of the judge of Israel. This prophecy also foretells the restoration of gentile salvation, as people and many nations will flock to the mountain of the Lord.",
