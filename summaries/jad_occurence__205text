  "summary": "The text describes a dire prophecy of suffering and destruction, where people will be consumed by famine and attacked by wild beasts and serpents. It mentions the tragedy of many Jews who gathered in Jerusalem on Passover, ultimately leading to their destruction as a divine punishment for the crucifixion of Jesus. Josephus documents this event, emphasizing the horrors of the famine and the desperation it inflicted on the people, including a gruesome story of a noblewoman named Mary who, driven mad by hunger, killed and partially consumed her own child. This depiction of suffering serves as an illustration of divine vengeance.",
