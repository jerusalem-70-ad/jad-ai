  "summary": "The text warns against disrespecting one's father or teacher, illustrating the consequences of such actions with biblical examples: Cham's mockery of his father Noah led to perpetual servitude for his descendants; Absalon's rebellion against his father David resulted in his death; and the mockery of Prophet Elisha by the children led to their slaughter by bears. This is paralleled with the Jews' mockery of Christ at Calvary, which was avenged 42 years after his ascension by the Roman generals Vespasian and Titus who brutally attacked Jerusalem.",
