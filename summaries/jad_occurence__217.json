  "summary": "The text describes a prophecy from the Lord about the desecration of the bones of the Judean king, princes, priests, prophets, and Jerusalem's inhabitants. These bones will be exposed to the sun, moon, and heavenly hosts they worshipped and will remain unburied, serving as manure on the earth's surface. Those left from this wicked group will choose death over life in the places they have been scattered by the Lord. This prophecy is fulfilled globally, not just in Jerusalem, showing the earth filled with the dead. The text also mentions that ancient customs of burying gold and ornaments with the dead led to greed-driven desecration where these treasures are unearthed.",
