  "summary": "The text discusses the metaphorical language used in Scripture to describe God, emphasizing that God, being immutable, does not literally possess wrath or fury. Instead, these terms are used in a way that humans can understand, signaling punishment or retribution to certain groups, such as demons or Jews. The passage specifically references God's retribution by conquering demons and diminishing Jewish authority and status by handing them over to the Romans. It clarifies that the mention of blood in Scripture does not imply literal blood for demons (as they are spirits) but refers to the blood of Christ, which they caused to be shed. The text also includes a biblical reference to Satan influencing Judas to betray Christ.",
