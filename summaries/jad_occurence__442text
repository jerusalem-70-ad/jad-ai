  "summary": "The text discusses reasons why God might have rejected His people, the house of Jacob, attributing it to them being filled with augurs, omens, and idolatry like in the beginning. It references how the Israelites were commanded not to follow such practices, which were followed by the Canaanites, Amorites, and Hittites whom God expelled. Different interpretations are offered by commentators, with some suggesting it refers to Roman armies taking over the land once promised to the Jews, leading to foreigners inhabiting Judea under Roman leaders like Titus and Hadrian. Others believe it refers to earlier times before the Babylonian destruction, under wicked kings, where God abandoned them. The text uses a Hebrew term to describe the attachment to foreign children, indicating moral corruption within Jewish society.",
