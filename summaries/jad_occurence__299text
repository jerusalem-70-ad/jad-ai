  "summary": "The text discusses the symbolic representation of the Synagogue as holding fidelity to Christ throughout various historical periods. Abigail is portrayed as a type of the faithful Synagogue that leads souls imbued with the rites of the Torah, which contains five books. This symbolizes the incorporation of Jewish Christians into the Church after the destruction brought by Vespasian and Titus, supported by ecclesiastical history. The text acknowledges the continuous presence and service of Jewish Christians in the Church, including leadership roles, until the time of Emperor Hadrian. Thus, Abigail represents those who believed in Christ during his lifetime, those who converted after his ascension through the apostles' preaching, and those who came to faith post-destruction of Jerusalem and persecution of Christians.",
