  "summary": "The text refers to the biblical figure Heliseus, interpreted as a representation of the Savior, who was mocked by the Jews similar to how Jesus was scorned. It draws a parallel between the mocking of Heliseus and the persecution of Jesus, with a focus on how, forty-two years after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, the Jews faced consequences from Roman leaders Vespasian and Titus. The narrative also includes a story of a woman seeking help from Heliseus, illustrating his divine intervention by miraculously multiplying oil to save her sons from servitude. This story is viewed allegorically as demonstrating the transfer of God's kingdom from Israel to the Church, symbolized by Mount Carmel.",
