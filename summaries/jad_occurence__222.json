  "summary": "The text discusses the prophecy about no one from the lineage of David sitting on the throne during his days, as no one from David's line held rule in Judea after captivity. It references Josephus, who notes that the priestly class from the tribe of Levi held leadership followed by Herod, the son of Antipater the proselyte, and that under Vespasian, the rule of this lineage was entirely erased. Additionally, there is a mention of lamentation over the pastors (leaders) who destroy and scatter the flock, as stated by the Lord.",
