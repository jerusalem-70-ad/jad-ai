  "summary": "The text discusses Jesus entering the temple of the Church and driving out those buying and selling spiritual goods, referring to it as a house of prayer. It mentions the temple's predicted destruction accompanied by weeping, which partially occurred under Julian and is expected to occur under the Antichrist. Under Julian, the temple was overthrown and trampled by Gentiles, and under the Antichrist, no stone will be left on another as the elect will be scattered. The Church entrusts itself to God in the Offertory and offers a sacrifice of praise to God in the Communion. The Gospel reading here foretells the destruction of Jerusalem, historically occurring in the same month first by Nebuchadnezzar and later by the Romans.",
