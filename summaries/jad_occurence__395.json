  "summary": "Eusebius discusses another interpretation of biblical prophecy, suggesting it extends over seventy years, divided between events from Jesus' death to Nero's reign and from the reign of Vespasian and Titus to Trajan's times. This period relates to the Roman actions against the Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem, which supposedly fulfilled the prophecy mentioned in Daniel about confirming a covenant for 'one week'. During this time, the apostles spread the Gospel extensively, with John the Evangelist said to have lived until Trajan's era.",
