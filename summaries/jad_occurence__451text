  "summary": "The text discusses a vision pertaining to a historical event involving Jerusalem. The Hebraic interpretation suggests that the vision does not refer to the time when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and led Zedekiah blindfolded to Babylon, but rather to the era of Sennacherib, when the high priest Sobna betrayed much of the city, leaving only Zion, the citadel, and the Temple, much like the Roman city preserved its patricians and youth during the Gaul invasion. The text considers interpretations related to both the Babylonian captivity and, as Eusebius suggests, the advent of Christ, particularly linked to the time of Vespasian and Titus. The query, 'What do you also have?' questions what prompted Zion to climb onto rooftops, as if seized like other nations besieged by enemies.",
