  "summary": "This text discusses the metaphorical cutting off of the Jewish people from the Promised Land by the Romans, drawing on a biblical imagery of a barren fig tree. It suggests that this act of 'cutting off' was proposed through repentance, due to the rejection of heavenly truths and persecution of the King of heaven and earth. The Jewish leaders' fear of losing their place to the Romans is highlighted, along with their obstruction of divine truth, as reflected in the rebuke of the hypocritical Scribes and Pharisees.",
