  "summary": "The text discusses the events leading to the final judgment by Christ, the Son of God, who will draw all to him and judge the living and the dead. Before the ultimate judgment, two judgments were to take place over earthly Jerusalem: one executed by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army due to the blood of the prophets, and another by the Romans for the murder of the Lord of the prophets. The first judgment by the Chaldeans is mentioned as an extension of God's hand over Judah and Jerusalem, and the second by the Romans is introduced as an impending day of the Lord.",
