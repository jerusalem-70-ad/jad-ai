  "summary": "The text describes a scene of mourning and sorrow, reflecting ancient customs of grief with sackcloth and shaved heads. It draws a parallel to the mourning of Job for his children and suggests a widespread lamentation that surpasses that of a mother for her only child. This scene is connected to the Passion of Christ, when darkness covered the earth as Christ was crucified. The festive celebrations of the people were turned into mourning, symbolizing their rejection of the \"Sun of Justice.\" As Israel is plunged into eternal mourning for their role in this, the passage highlights a transition, where those in darkness have seen a great light, and the festivities of the Jews have been transformed into celebrations within the Church. The text implies a deep sorrow for those who have lost their spiritual light contrasted with the newfound joy of the Church.",
