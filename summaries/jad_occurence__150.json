  "summary": "The text discusses the parable of individuals who ignore the divine invitation to the king's marriage, preferring earthly labors or secular profits. It illustrates the hostility towards the calling, with some not only refusing the invitation but also persecuting the messengers. The king, in response to this hostility, sends armies to destroy the murderers and burn their city. This parable is metaphorically linked to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans led by Vespasian and Titus, and the spiritual implications of eternal punishment.",
