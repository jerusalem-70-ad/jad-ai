  "summary": "The text discusses how the Most High, who resides in the heavens amongst good angels and holy humans, will mock those who opposed Him. It references how the apostles' efforts led to the world beginning to believe in Christ, whom they had denied before Pilate. It also mentions the Roman army's role in the destruction of their place and people, and how, in future judgment, the apostles will condemn the twelve tribes of Israel for not believing as they did. The interaction between Pilate and Christ, where Pilate boasts of his power over Christ, is also recalled.",
