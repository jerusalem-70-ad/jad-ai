  "summary": "The text describes a king who becomes angry upon hearing certain news and sends armies to destroy murderers and burn their city. The king, previously described as a man inviting guests to a wedding as an act of mercy, is now referred to solely as a king when exacting vengeance. The armies sent are likened to avenging angels, possibly referencing Roman forces under Vespasian and Titus who destroyed the sinful city. The destruction signifies judgment executed by angels, aligning with the concept of divine armies serving the king, known as Lord of Hosts. It discusses themes of divine retribution and judgment on persecutors, extending to their souls and bodies subjected to eternal flames.",
