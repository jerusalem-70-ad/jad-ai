  "summary": "The text discusses God's displeasure with the people's abominations, leading Him to turn His face away from them. This results in the violation and contamination of His sacred secrets, specifically referring to the Holy of Holies. Historically, this sacred space was only accessible to priests and the high priest, but it was desecrated by invaders such as the Babylonians, King Antiochus, and subsequently by Vespasian and Titus during the temple's capture and destruction. The desecration reflects the mismanagement and corruption of what should have been holy and pure, likened to Christ's cleansing of the Temple. The text highlights the consequences of immoral actions leading to sacred spaces being defiled by the impious.",
