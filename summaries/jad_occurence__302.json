  "summary": "The text discusses the consequences of avarice and how it metaphorically consumes like fire. It mentions the prophecy that wealth accumulated through greed will eventually lead to wrath in the last days. This is seen to have been fulfilled after the death of James when Jerusalem and the province of Judea were attacked and revealed by the Romans. The passage encourages patience among the oppressed believers, promising that the end of their suffering is near, either through their deliverance by the Lord or by the removal of power from their persecutors.",
