  "summary": "The text recounts events during Nero's and Vespasian's reigns. In Nero's second year, Festus becomes the procurator of Judaea, succeeding Felix, and sends Paul to Rome. James, the brother of Jesus, is stoned by the Jews in the seventh year of Nero's rule after thirty years of leading the Jerusalem Church. Jewish rebellion against Roman governors Albinus and Florus leads to Vespasian being appointed to suppress the revolt in Judaea. Under Nero, severe persecution of Christians occurs, resulting in the execution of the apostles Peter and Paul in Rome. The military is ineffective, and Britain is nearly lost. During Vespasian's rule, proclaimed emperor in Judaea and leaving Titus to continue the war, Jerusalem is conquered by Titus, who demolishes its temple in the second year of his campaign. The Jewish War lasts four years, starting under Nero and continuing after his death.",
