  "summary": "In the fifth month, which is called August by the Romans, a rebellion arose among the people due to the spies of the Holy Land, and they were ordered not to ascend the mountain but to wander in the wilderness for forty years until all except Caleb and Joshua fell. In this month, the temple in Jerusalem was burned and destroyed by Nabuchadnezzar and later by Titus and Vespasian, and the city of Bether was captured. The temple was desecrated by Turannius Rufus in disgrace to the oppressed people. In the seventh month, known as October, Godolias was killed, leading to the dispersion of Judah's tribes and the remnants of Jerusalem. In the tenth month, known as January, Ezekiel, while in captivity, heard that the temple had been overthrown, as described by the prophet.",
