  "summary": "The text uses the story of Eliseus and the mocking children to symbolize the Jews who mocked Christ as he ascended to Calvary. It suggests that the phrase 'Ascende, calve' was used in mockery as He was crucified. The act of crucifixion involved shaving the head, which was possibly done to Christ. The story of two bears consuming forty children is seen as a parallel to the Roman Emperors Titus and Vespasian who, forty years later, destroyed the Jewish people. Additionally, demons, depicted as savage bears, also devoured them. Those who mock Christ's crucifixion share the fate of being devoured, akin to the mocking children, while those who revere His passion are likened to the sons of Core (Korach), or the 'sons of the bald one'.",
