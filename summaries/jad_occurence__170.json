  "summary": "Jesus, after leaving the temple, was approached by his disciples who showed him its construction. He told them that the temple would be completely destroyed, which was fulfilled under Titus and Vespasian. The disciples, curious about the end times, asked Jesus about the signs of his coming and the end of the world. Jesus warned them against being misled by false prophets, mentioning that many would claim to be Christ and deceive many, referencing Simon Magus and referring to future acts of the Antichrist.",
