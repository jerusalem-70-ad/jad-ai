  "summary": "The text draws a parallel between the biblical story of Elisha, who was mocked by children, and the Jewish people mocking Jesus at his crucifixion. It tells how Elisha cursed the children, resulting in bears coming out of the forest to kill them. Similarly, after Jesus' resurrection and ascension, the destruction of Jerusalem 42 years later by Roman generals Vespasian and Titus is seen as Christ's retribution towards the Jews.",
