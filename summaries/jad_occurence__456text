  "summary": "The text discusses the various conquests and dominations over Judea, starting with the Macedonians and successors of Alexander, particularly Antiochus Epiphanes, who severely oppressed the region. It then mentions the Roman Empire's dominance over the Jews, ultimately leading to their expulsion. The actions of Vespasian, Titus, and Hadrian against the Jews are noted, specifically Hadrian's destruction of Jerusalem, leading to the founding of a new city named Aelia after him. The text links these historical events to the vision of four horns seen by Zachariah, which represented the powers that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.",
