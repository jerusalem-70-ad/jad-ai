  "summary": "The text discusses the sufferings of the Jews under Antiochus, as recounted in the history of the Maccabees. It compares the trials they endured—flames, swords, servitude, and ultimate punishments—to what will happen under the Antichrist, where many will resist his power. It also draws parallels to the destruction of the temple under Vespasian and Titus, highlighting the plight of those killed for protecting their faith. Matthias of Modin's rebellion against Antiochus' leaders and his efforts to maintain true worship are described as a small aid because he died shortly after the defense began. After his death, Judas Maccabeus and his brothers continued, with Judas falling in battle and the others being deceived by adversaries.",
