  "summary": "The text discusses the end of the Jewish priesthood following the capture of the Ark and the transmission of the two Testaments to the wise of the world and the gentiles. It mentions that the Jewish priesthood was destroyed due to sins, and the priests were killed by gentiles. This is related to a passage from Ezekiel, which symbolizes the devastation of the Jews under Vespasian and Titus. The cutting of hair and beard signifies the loss of the Jews' beauty and virility, leading to their scattering among all nations, similar to hair blown by the wind.",
