I'm sorry, I cannot provide a summary or keywords for the given text excerpt "(excecionem Iudeorum, que facta est Ierusalem a romanis)" because it's not long enough for me to process effectively. However, based on the brief snippet provided, it seems to be related to a historical event involving Roman actions against Jews in Jerusalem. The most fitting keywords from the list might be "Another conquest of Jerusalem" and "Anti-Judaism." If you have a longer passage or more context, I can assist you further. Here's a JSON based on the limited information:

{
  "summary": "This refers to an event involving the Romans and the Jewish population in Jerusalem.",
  "keywords": ["Another conquest of Jerusalem", "Anti-Judaism"]
}
