  "summary": "As Jesus approached Jerusalem, he wept over the city, lamenting its lack of understanding of what brings peace. He foresaw the impending destruction by the Romans that would leave Jerusalem devastated. Jesus then entered the temple and expelled the merchants, declaring that it should be a house of prayer and not a den of thieves. His actions highlighted that the downfall of the people was largely due to the failings of the priests. The city's fate was tied to its failure to recognize the time of its visitation by its Creator.",
