  "summary": "The text discusses the restraint that some maintain despite being bound, contemplating how severe they would be if unbound. It references a Gospel parable about a fig tree, illustrating how the apostles predicted the Jews would be cut off by the Romans. The Euphrates River is used as a metaphor for secular power, which is where the devil allegedly resides in the leaders of this world. Predicted is an end-time persecution where the devil, presently restrained, will cause harm. The Babylonian conquest is referenced, showing the division of the Euphrates by the Medes and Persians, highlighting its frequent negative connotations.",
