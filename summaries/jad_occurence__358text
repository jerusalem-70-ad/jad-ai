  "summary": "The text discusses the response of the Jewish leaders, specifically the pontiffs and Pharisees, after Jesus performed the miracle of resurrecting Lazarus. Many Jews believed in Jesus after witnessing this miracle, while others reported his actions to the Pharisees. Driven by malice and the fear of losing their temporal power to the Romans, the Jewish leaders convened a council to plot Jesus' death rather than converting and believing in him. Caiaphas, the high priest for that year, prophesied that it was better for one man (Jesus) to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish. The text suggests that Caiaphas' words, though given with malicious intent, were a prophetic acknowledgment of Jesus' sacrificial death, which would ultimately gather the scattered children of God into one. The narrative also mentions that the Romans, under Titus and Vespasian, later destroyed Jerusalem and the Jewish nation as punishment for their actions against Jesus.",
