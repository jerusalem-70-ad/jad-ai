  "summary": "The text addresses the Jewish people, condemning them as murderers for rejecting and plotting against a man who brought their dead back to life. It warns them that by killing him, they ultimately bring destruction upon themselves in a manner that the world will marvel at and even their enemies will pity. The author refers to the Jews' self-destruction under the Romans Titus and Vespasian, calling them a unique nation of self-harming murderers. Furthermore, the text references a statement made by Jesus, indicating that he comes from above and they from below, and that they will die in their sins because they cannot follow where he is going.",
