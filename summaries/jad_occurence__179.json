  "summary": "The text discusses the opening of the sixth seal, which signifies the downfall of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles. This event is associated with the actions and teachings of Christ, who spoke in parables and whose words and deeds were later clarified to the Church's teachers through divine inspiration. The 'great earthquake' refers to the destruction of the Jewish nation by the Romans, and the 'sun becoming black' symbolizes the Jewish people, who were once considered eminent for their monotheism and observance of the Law, but became despised due to their iniquities.",
