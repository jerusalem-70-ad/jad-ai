  "summary": "The text discusses the allegorical interpretation of Core (meaning 'calvaria' which is the site of the Passion of Christ) and its relation to biblical events. It draws a parallel between the ridicule faced by the prophet Elisha by 42 children, and the mocking cries of Jewish people towards Christ during his crucifixion. It also interprets the destruction brought upon the Jews by the Roman generals Titus and Vespasian forty-two years after Christ's resurrection as similar to the fate of the mocking children.",
