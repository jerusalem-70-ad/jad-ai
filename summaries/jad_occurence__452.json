  "summary": "The text discusses the prophetic order concerning the prophetic speech threatening Damascus, which once aided the ten tribes by seeking God's mercy. Now, the desolation of Egypt is foretold as Egypt is associated with not invoking God due to its reliance on outside help. Egypt is described metaphorically as the land beyond the Nile from Ethiopia. Some interpret this prophecy to refer to the Roman Empire during the times of Vespasian and Titus, which saw Jerusalem's destruction. However, the text suggests that this interpretation does not align with Christian faith, unless taken spiritually within the context of the Church.",
