  "summary": "The text discusses the period from the birth of Christ to the Judgment Day, highlighting its acceptance by God the Father due to the salvation brought through the apostles' preaching. It references the Apostle Paul's declaration of the 'acceptable time' and 'day of salvation.' Additionally, it discusses the day of vengeance against the Jews, fulfilled through the Romans following Christ's ascension, as prophesied when enemies would surround Jerusalem. This 'vengeful day' is seen as 'acceptable' to God not from a desire for destruction but as a form of divine justice, akin to human joy in avenging enemies.",
