  "summary": "The text discusses a plea for God's wrath to be poured out like a great flood upon the enemies, drawing a parallel to the time when the Roman army devastated the Jewish people and their buildings, leaving no stone unturned. This event is portrayed as a manifestation of God's rightful anger, which, although not constant, is kindled when sinners persist without repentance. The call for divine wrath is portrayed as a way to prevent internal anger from escalating into uncontrollable fury due to the lack of correction from mild rebukes.",
