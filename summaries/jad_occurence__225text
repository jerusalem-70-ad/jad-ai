  "summary": "The text discusses the biblical story of Elisha and the mocking children from the book of Kings. It explains that when Elisha was mocked by children on his way to Bethel, two bears emerged and killed forty-two of them after Elisha cursed them in the name of the Lord. The text interprets this event as a typology for Jesus Christ's experience with Jewish mockers during his crucifixion. It further allegorizes the bears as Titus and Vespasian, who destroyed the Jewish nation forty-two years after Christ's passion. The text concludes by comparing the earthly power represented by the bears to the force in the Antichrist's body, which tramples upon the weak and servants of God.",
