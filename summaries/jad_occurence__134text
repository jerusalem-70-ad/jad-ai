  "summary": "In the year 72 AD, during the founding year 822 of Rome, Vespasian was sent by Nero with an army to Judea. After Nero's death, Vespasian was declared emperor by his army. He left his son Titus in Judea to besiege Jerusalem and traveled to Rome via Alexandria. Vespasian, the seventh emperor after Augustus, ruled for nine years. Though he was of humble birth, he was recognized for his military prowess, having campaigned in Germany and Britain where he fought extensively and expanded the Roman Empire. As emperor, he ruled moderately and notably did not retain grudges, even marrying off the daughter of his enemy Vitellius to a nobleman with a large dowry.",
