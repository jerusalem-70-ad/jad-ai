  "summary": "The text discusses a person who is a friend of the world and thereby an enemy of God. Such a person opposes Christ, analogous to the people who called for Christ's crucifixion. The worldly individuals feared losing their place and nation to the Romans if they allowed Christ's message to spread. The writer emphasizes that the spirit of envy against Christ persists and urges those who belong to Christ to arm themselves with zeal against Christ's persecutors and to call for action against the enemy of Christ.",
