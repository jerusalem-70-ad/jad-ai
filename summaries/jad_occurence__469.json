It also discusses how the Romans defeated the Jews yet allowed them to retain their customs and religious practices, even after the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of the traditional priesthood, as foretold by prophets. It notes that Jews maintain their distinct traditions and circumcision, differentiating them from other nations.",
