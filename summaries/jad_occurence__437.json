  "summary": "The passage discusses a divine decree in which the people will hear but not understand, and see but not perceive, as a result of their hardness of heart and forgetfulness of their Creator. The prophet inquires how long this will last, and God responds that it will continue until the cities of the Jews are utterly destroyed by Vespasian and Titus, leading to a desolation of the land and a scattering of the Jewish people across the world. The text also mentions that the remaining portion of Jews, barely a tenth of the prior population, will face further predation when Emperor Hadrian ravages the land about fifty years later, leaving it as desolate as a ravaged tree.",
