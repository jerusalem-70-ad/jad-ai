  "summary": "The text uses a metaphor of stars falling to the earth and fruits falling from a fig tree to symbolize the fall of the Jewish religious leaders and people. The stars represent the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, while the fig tree represents the land of the Jews. The falling fruits are likened to the Jews who are described as worthless, expelled to make way for the faithful after the Roman invasion. This serves as an apocalyptic warning about the consequences of the Jewish people's rejection of God.",
