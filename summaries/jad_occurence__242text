  "summary": "The text discusses the futile plans of the Jewish leaders who tried to keep Jesus dead and buried to prevent the world from following him and to avoid Roman intervention. However, their plans failed as Jesus resurrected and the world started following him. The narrative mentions how their scheming resulted in the opposite of their intentions; instead of leaving him be, their actions led to Roman intervention and destruction of their city. The allegory draws a parallel with biblical figures and events, emphasizing how divine plans overshadow human malice, turning intended harm into good.",
