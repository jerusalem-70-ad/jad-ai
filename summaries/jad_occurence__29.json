  "summary": "The text draws a parallel between the biblical story of Elisha and the children who mocked him, leading to their punishment by bears, and the fate of the Jews who mocked Jesus, the Son of God and Savior, during his crucifixion. After Jesus' resurrection and ascension, he, like Elisha, turned against the Jews, leading to the destruction of the Jewish people by Romans Vespasian and Titus in the forty-second year after Jesus' ascension. This event is depicted as divine vengeance against those who mocked Christ.",
