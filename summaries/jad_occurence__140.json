  "summary": "The text describes a parallel between the biblical figure Elisha, who cursed blaspheming children resulting in their death by bears, and Christ, who after his resurrection and ascension, similarly cursed the Jews. It draws an analogy to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, marking it as divine vengeance led by Vespasian and Titus in the 42nd year after Christ's ascension.",
