  "summary": "The text describes a vision by John of the holy city of New Jerusalem descending from heaven, prepared by God like a bride for her husband. This new Jerusalem is distinct from the one destroyed by the Chaldeans and Romans, as prophesized by the Lord. Instead, it refers to the celestial Jerusalem, mentioned by the Apostle, as free and the mother of all. This new Jerusalem symbolizes a renewed path of life, imitating the new man, and is primarily in heaven, where angels and the souls of the saints reside, hence it is described as descending.",
