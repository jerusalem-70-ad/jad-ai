  "summary": "John the Apostle and Evangelist, son of Zebedee, was chosen by the Lord as a virgin and loved more than others. He reclined on the Master's chest, drawing the essence of the Gospel from the sacred well of the Lord's heart and spreading the grace of God's word across the earth like a river in paradise. He succeeded Christ by taking in Christ's mother at Jesus' behest, becoming like another son. While preaching in Asia, he was exiled to the island of Patmos by Emperor Domitian, where he wrote the Apocalypse with his own hand. After Domitian's assassination, John was released from exile and returned to Ephesus, where, at the request of the bishops of Asia, he authored his Gospel, known for its great signs, such as turning wild rods into gold and shore rocks into gems.",
