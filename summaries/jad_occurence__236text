  "summary": "The text calls for divine judgment against the corrupt and sinful practices within the Church, drawing parallels to the historical fall of Jerusalem where God judged the city's wicked leaders. It mentions past divine interventions where the humble and faithful were spared, and urges God to rise against modern-day corrupt figures within the Church who are likened to historical traitors and sinners such as Simon, Judas, and Nicholas, reminiscent of Jerusalem's chaotic leadership. The appeal reflects themes of divine vengeance and the necessity of purging the Church from evil influences.",
