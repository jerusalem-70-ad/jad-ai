  "summary": "The text presents a narration from the perspective of the Church, a fortified city surrounded by enemies, who has offered its adversary, the Synagogue, a useless drink. Eventually, the city will fall at night, its walls will collapse, and powers that contest it now it will dominate. The city is depicted as being filled with brambles and thorns and lacking in valuable crops, prompting the speaker to abandon it. The apostles, originating from within, declare that they must first speak the word of God to them, yet they have rejected it and deemed themselves unworthy of eternal life. Therefore, they turn to the gentiles. The Lord will fulfill His threats, and everyone in it will burn, surrounded by a Roman fire. Alternatively, they may burn with vices and sins, unable to extinguish the devil's fiery arrows; they are adulterers with hearts like an oven.",
