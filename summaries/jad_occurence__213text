  "summary": "The text discusses a king who, after facing rejection by those he invited to a wedding, sends his armies to destroy the murderers and burn down their city. This is compared to Godâ€™s retribution against those who were unworthy of the invitation to His Kingdom, and could allude to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. The passage concludes with a directive to invite anyone found on the streets to the wedding feast, symbolizing the call to all people to join the divine kingdom.",
