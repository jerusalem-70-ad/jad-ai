  "summary": "The text discusses a passage in which the Jewish people interpret the prophecy of being raised and the reversal of their misfortune as a future promise of regrouping in Jerusalem and triumphing over the Romans. They envision a divine retribution where they will sell Roman children, not to neighbors like Persians or Ethiopians, but to the far-distant Sabaeans, as a form of divine vengeance for their past humiliations. The author contrasts this view by suggesting that the prophecy refers to those who claim to be Jews but are not, labeling them as part of Satan's synagogues, and predicting their downfall under the symbolisms of Tyre, Sidon, and the Philistine territory.",
