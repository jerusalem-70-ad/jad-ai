  "summary": "The text describes the sudden emergence of a bandit against those who plotted to ensnare the speaker and hide traps for him. It acknowledges that God is aware of all their deadly conspiracies against him. The plea is for God not to forgive their iniquity and for their sins to remain before Him. The text suggests interpreting the sudden bandit as Nebuchadnezzar if referring to Jeremiah, or the Roman army if referring to the Savior, which is considered more accurate and better. It also justifies God's sentence by recounting what they did against Christ, the Son of God, and what they suffered as a consequence.",
