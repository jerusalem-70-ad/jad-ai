  "summary": "After the ascension of the Lord and the death of James, called the Just, the Jewish people continued in their malice. In response, God raised two Roman leaders, Vespasian and his son Titus, to act as instruments of divine justice. As the Roman army devastated the region of the Jews, the Jews flocked to the city for the Passover festival as if they were one. This was seen as divine retribution, as they had crucified Christ during the same festival. The city was suddenly besieged by enemies, and no one could enter or leave until their provisions were exhausted.",
