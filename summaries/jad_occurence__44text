  "summary": "The text explains that the Temple, referred to as that of the Lord, is not the ancient and marvelous work of King Solomon. The city of Jerusalem, along with Solomon's Temple, was destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar and later by King Antiochus before the birth of Christ. Following Christ's prophecy, Jerusalem was again completely destroyed by Roman leaders Vespasian and Titus, leaving no stone upon another. The modern temple, rebuilt by contemporary Christian worshippers, is attested by many to be constructed on the same site where Solomon placed the original tabernacle of God made from cedars and Parian marble, including the Holy of Holies.",
