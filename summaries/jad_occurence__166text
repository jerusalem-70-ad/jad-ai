  "summary": "Stephen is referred to as the standard-bearer of martyrs because he was the first to enter heaven with the victory palm in the same year as the Lord. His body, stoned by Jews and exposed to beasts and birds, remained untouched due to the protection of a divine angel. Gamaliel later honorably buried his body. Afterward, in vengeance for the Lord, the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, devastated the region, executed some Jews, and sold others. Once Roman leaders accepted the faith and nations began worshipping Christ, a divine vision revealed the location of Stephen's body to Christians, celebrated by seventy-three miracles.",
