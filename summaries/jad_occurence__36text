It focuses on the siege of Jerusalem, symbolized by the \"abomination of desolation,\" which could be the Roman General Vespasian who besieged and destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple. The urgency is such that those on rooftops wouldn't have time to descend and gather belongings, highlighting the severity and merciless nature of the persecution, with no compassion shown even to pregnant and nursing women.","keywords":["Another conquest of Jerusalem", "Typology", "Temple"]}
