  "summary": "The text elaborates on the sinful actions and offenses of certain people, whom it metaphorically refers to as having speech full of cursing and bitterness against God, as seen in their call to crucify Christ. Their 'feet', representing their affections, are quick to shed the blood of the Savior. The pathways they take result in their destruction and eternal damnation, as seen during the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian, and their subsequent captivity throughout the world. They did not recognize the way of peace, which is Christ, who stated, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life.' The Apostle mentions Christ as their peace, who united divided groups. These people committed various evils because the fear of God was not in their hearts. The text attributes their failure to recognize Christ to a lack of divine apprehension, as they would not have crucified the Lord of glory had they known him.",
