  "summary": "The text discusses the end of the reliance on promises and figurative elements like the kingdom, priesthood, temple, and circumcision, following the arrival of truth in Christ. It critiques a part of the synagogue that ignored the heavenly promises and clung to earthly possessions, leading to the crucifixion of Christ and consequently their own downfall. This calamity is symbolically represented in the psalm interpreted by Asaph, which laments the cause of the irreparable destruction. The psalm encourages a shift from earthly concerns and the Old Testament to spiritual expectations in the New Testament.",
