  "summary": "The text describes a prophecy that depicts the hardening of the hearts of the people until the cities of Judea are completely desolated by the forces led by Vespasian and Titus. The cities will be so thoroughly destroyed that even their names will not remain, houses will be left uninhabited, and the land will become desolate. The Jewish people will be dispersed across the world through flight or captivity and will multiply among all nations instead of remaining only in Judea.",
