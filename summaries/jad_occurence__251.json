  "summary": "The text is a plea to the Father, asking Him not to remain silent in the face of unjust acts and to bring forth judgment and punishment upon those responsible. The speaker reflects on how God seemed silent during the Passion of Christ, as no retribution was exacted immediately. However, as a judge, God eventually delivered judgment through the destruction by the Romans. The speaker asks for constancy and strength to remain steadfast until justice is served.",
