  "summary": "The text reflects on a passage where Jesus approaches Jerusalem and weeps for the city, foreseeing its future destruction. This sorrow is linked to the historical conquest of Jerusalem by Vespasian and Titus. It emphasizes the city's ignorance of its impending doom. Jesus laments that if the city had known what was coming, it would have grieved rather than celebrated its earthly pleasures, given that it was unaware of the forthcoming calamity.",
