  "summary": "The text discusses the wrathful face of the Lord as mentioned in the context of the Roman conquest of Jerusalem. It references how the internal divisions and conflicts among the people of Jerusalem mirrored the idea that the 'face of the Lord' had turned against them, resulting in their own destruction. The priests were shameless and showed no pity for the elders, as described by Josephus, highlighting the fulfillment of the divine message that God would no longer look upon them with favor but allow them to perish due to their own seditions.",
