  "summary": "The text discusses the swift actions and unfortunate paths of the impious, who quickly shed the blood of Christ and his followers. It is highlighted that their ways are filled with labor and misery because they have not known the way of peace, which is described by the Lord as his gentle yoke. This is particularly directed at the Jews, who faced destruction and misfortune with the conquests of Titus and Vespasian, leading them to a fatal end. The path of the wicked is metaphorically described as one of destruction and unhappiness because there is no benefit in their suffering unlike the holy martyrs who ascend to heaven through their present trials. They do not return because they have not known the way of peace, which is Christ.",
