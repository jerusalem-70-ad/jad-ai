  "summary": "The text reflects on a verse from the Psalms, suggesting that God showed mercy by not killing the enemies, but dispersing them. This is related not only to the dispersion of the Jews under Vespasian and Titus, but also to the captivity of the ten tribes by the Assyrians. The prophet foresaw both captivities as a means to confirm the faith of the nations across the earth, ensuring that even a remnant of the people, like 'two legs or part of an ear from the mouth of the lion,' would testify to God's justice and the truth of Scriptures. This dispersion would carry the truth of Christ, the Son of God, as known from law and prophets, everywhere.",
