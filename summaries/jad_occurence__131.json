  "summary": "The text describes a symbolic vision involving a red horse and its rider, identified as the devil, who is given the power to remove peace from the earth and cause people to kill one another. This allegory emphasizes the contrast between this deceitful and bloodthirsty force and the earlier faithful horse. The devil uses his power, granted by God, to instigate both physical and spiritual violence, and wield a great sword of destruction. This metaphor highlights the diabolical attempt to thwart the establishment of the Church by destroying its leaders and instigating chaos.",
