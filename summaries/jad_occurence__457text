  "summary": "The text discusses how the people of God were once divided by the adversarial nations, specifically worldly leaders and rulers of darkness. These leaders not only divided God's people but also led the youth to change their natural inclinations, as discussed by the Apostle concerning dishonorable passions. Moreover, they sold a girl for wine, prioritizing lust over sobriety. These events are said to have occurred during the times of Vespasian, Titus, and most notably Hadrian. The narrative extends to the judgment day, when all who are saved will be within the Church or heavenly Jerusalem. After the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem is converted, all will be gathered in the valley of Jehoshaphat for the Lord to judge those who persecuted and divided His people. This judgment applies not only to heretics but also to any authoritarian and proud teachers who, under the guise of doctrine and priesthood, dominate over the clergy and oppress their subjects.",
