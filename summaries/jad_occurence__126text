  "summary": "The text discusses the symbolism of the boar representing the ferocity of the rulers of this age, as noted in the psalm about the Lord's vineyard. It describes the boar as having ravaged the vineyard, symbolizing the scattering and destruction faced by the Jewish people. The boar is possibly a reference to Vespasian, who was fierce against the Jews, and Titus, his son, further devastated the people and city with great violence. The vineyard's demise was seen as necessary due to the absence of its protective barriers.",
