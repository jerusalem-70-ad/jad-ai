  "summary": "The text discusses the foretelling of events by a prophet, specifically the persecution faced by the Jews from Titus and Vespasian after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This persecution is lamented in a psalm. Despite the rejection of Christ and the killing of His martyrs by the Jewish people, there were still righteous individuals within them such as Joseph, Mary, Simeon, and many who believed in redemption. Therefore, the Jewish people are still considered God's inheritance. The text reflects on how prophets often declare God's actions and request His mercy in prayers. It explores the spiritual significance and typology of these historical events.",
