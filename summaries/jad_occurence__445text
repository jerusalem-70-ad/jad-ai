  "summary": "The text laments the people who waste their days in indulgence and fail to recognize the works of the Lord and the purpose of their creation. It references the historical captivity of the Jewish people under Roman leaders Vespasian and Titus, as recounted in both Greek and Latin histories. The people suffer not from lack of food and water, but from a lack of hearing the word of God. This is linked to a spiritual deprivation and ignorance of God's messages delivered through the Prophets. The text also references Psalms, attributing the people's spiritual hunger to their failure to observe God's works.",
