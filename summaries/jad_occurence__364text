{"summary":"The text discusses the importance of prayer during times of large-scale distress and upheaval, such as the fall of Jerusalem under Titus and Vespasian. In such events, people should pray that their flight does not occur during winter, when harsh cold can impede escape, or on the Sabbath, when attempting to escape could either break the law or leave individuals vulnerable to imminent death if they stay. Additionally, in a broader eschatological sense, the text advises maintaining strong faith and love in Christ and not becoming complacent in performing God's work.","keywords":["Another conquest of Jerusalem", "Apocalypticism", "Spiritual exegesis"]}
