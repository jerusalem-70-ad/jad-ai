  "summary": "The text references the prophet Ezekiel, where God says He will make Ezekiel's tongue stick to the roof of his mouth, preventing him from rebuking the people, as they are obstinate. This is likened to the atrium given to the Gentiles and associating Jews with Gentiles due to their disbelief. The Jews were handed over to Gentiles, particularly the Romans, for destruction. The holy city will be trampled for forty-two months, which is metaphorically tied to Elijah and Enoch's future role during the times of the Antichrist. It suggests that through Elijah and Enoch's preaching, the Jews will return to Christ in the end times. Antichrist and his followers will persecute the Church during these forty-two months, equating to three and a half years.",
