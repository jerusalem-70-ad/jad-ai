  "summary": "During the reign of Achaz, king of Judah and son of Joatham and grandson of Ozias, leaders Rasin of Syria and Phacee of Israel attacked Jerusalem but failed to conquer it. Meanwhile, the prophet Isaiah foresaw the blindness of the Jewish people and the eventual downfall of Jerusalem under Roman rulers Vespasian and Hadrian. Achaz engaged in idolatry by worshiping Baal, closing the temple doors, and replacing Solomon's altar with one modeled after an idol altar from Damascus. Consequently, he was forsaken by God and faced attacks from Rasin and Phacee.",
