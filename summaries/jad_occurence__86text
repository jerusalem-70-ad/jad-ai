  "summary": "The text reflects on the prophetic fulfillment concerning those who deny Christ, focusing on the Jewish people who rejected Jesus as their king and were subsequently punished as predicted. The passage emphasizes how they are no longer considered God's people due to their denial. This prophecy is linked to historical events such as the Roman destruction of Jerusalem under Vespasian and Titus, which resulted in the obliteration of the Jewish kingdom and widespread suffering. The desolation was predicted in scriptures and serves as a testament to the enduring consequences of rejecting Christ.",
