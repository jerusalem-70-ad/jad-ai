  "summary": "The text describes a divine retribution where a figure, who either strikes or will strike nations, prepares punishment due to the wrath of the Almighty God. The imagery of 'treading the winepress' is used to symbolize the pressure and destruction that will befall a people by the Roman Empire, specifically referring to the armies of Titus and Vespasian. It draws on prophetic imagery, comparing the afflicted people to a vineyard that should have produced good grapes but instead yielded sour grapes, as predicted by God in prophecy. This foretold punishment is stored in God's treasures, as mentioned in the song of Moses.",
