  "summary": "The text explores the idea that a significant city will be brought low or humbled. While the Jewish interpretation suggests this city to be Rome, the author argues it is actually Jerusalem. Jerusalem is depicted as the city that killed prophets and ultimately the son of the householder, leading to its downfall. The text describes a dual humiliation of Jerusalem, first by the Babylonians, who destroyed the temple, and secondly by the Romans under Titus and Vespasian. This destruction is said to be ongoing. The passage also references the 'feet of the poor', likely referring to Christ and the apostles who were not received and symbolically shook the dust from their feet against the city. It concludes with a broader theological reflection on the idea that those who exalt themselves will be humbled, while the humble will be exalted, a concept applicable to both individuals and opposing forces.",
