  "summary": "James, known for his remarkable virtue and justice, was called Oblias, which means the defense of the people and justice. Not long after, Vespasian's siege followed, which many Jews believed was a consequence of their wrongful attack on James, a just man and brother of Jesus, known as Christ. The ongoing violence against Jews is seen as a punishment for their actions against Jesus. Meanwhile, Festus dies in Judea, Albinus succeeds him, appointed by Caesar, followed by Florus. Florus's greed and cruelty, exemplified by flagging and crucifying people in the holy city, lead to rebellion against the Romans. Subsequently, Vespasian is sent to defeat the Jews.",
