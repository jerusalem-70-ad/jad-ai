  "summary": "The text reflects on the idea that the Philistines should not rejoice as the rod of their oppressor is shattered. It recalls the plot against the Lord where Caiphas, the high priest, determined one man should die to save the people, fearing Roman intervention if Jesus was allowed to continue. The text draws an analogy to Joseph, who was sold into Egypt by his brothers to prevent his dream of being adored by them from being fulfilled, which ironically led to the fulfillment of that dream.",
