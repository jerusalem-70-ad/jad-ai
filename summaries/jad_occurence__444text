  "summary": "The text describes Godâ€™s prophecy against the mountains and hills, signaling the destruction of high places and altars. It mentions a historical perspective referring to the Roman conquests, particularly during the times of Emperors Vespasian and Hadrian, where no fortress or wall could withstand the Roman army. The people of Judea were overwhelmed with fear, leading them to hide in the earth with their families and treasures. Some interpretations link these events to the Babylonian conquest and suggest a typological reading of the events, relating them to spiritual vigilance and construction of fortitude against enemies.",
