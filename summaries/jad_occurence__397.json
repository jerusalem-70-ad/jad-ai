  "summary": "The text discusses how God turns his face away from the abominations of the people, leading to the violation of the sacred place known as the Holy of Holies. It references historical instances when such sanctity was invaded, like during the Babylonian conquest, by King Antiochus, Pompey, and ultimately under Vespasian and Titus when the temple was captured and destroyed. The text draws parallels between these past events and contemporary sins, suggesting that God's absence allows for the desecration of holy places, which should have been pure and holy but are turned into places of impurity, as warned in the gospel by referring to the temple being turned into a 'den of robbers'.",
