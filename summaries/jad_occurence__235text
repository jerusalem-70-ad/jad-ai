  "summary": "The text discusses an interpretation of Asaph's understanding related to the final judgment, drawing a parallel with scriptural allegories rather than dreams. It contrasts the destructiveness of a sanctified temple and holy city with the ultimate destruction at the final judgment day, which will affect not just specific cities or temples but the entire world. It references the Apostle's allegorical interpretation of the two women representing the two Testaments and applies this method to comprehend the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in an eschatological context, emphasizing that the judgment begins with the sanctuary and expands to all nations persecuting the Church of God. It warns against the violation of the Temple of God, which represents the body as the temple of the Holy Spirit, following the Apostolic teachings.",
