  "summary": "The text criticizes a group of scholars who approved of the Redeemer's death because they feared losing the profits from old offerings. They conspired with the Pharisees, worrying that if they let Jesus continue, everyone would believe in him, resulting in the Romans taking away their place and nation. The text highlights their recognition of Jesus's influence yet their unwillingness to change due to selfish interests. It further explores the consequences of this decision and God's declaration concerning their house not ministering before Him eternally.",
