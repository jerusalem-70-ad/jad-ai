  "summary": "The passage describes a prophetic pronouncement of severe and prolonged punishment on the people of Judah, Israel, or Ephraim. This punishment is said to continue until the Roman army arrives, ultimately serving as vengeance for the blood of Christ. This is testified by Christ Himself, who earlier spoke through the prophets. As He was being led to crucifixion, Christ advised the daughters of Jerusalem to weep not for Him, but for themselves and their children, indicating a foretold time of great suffering when 'blessed' will be those who are barren and have not nursed children.",
