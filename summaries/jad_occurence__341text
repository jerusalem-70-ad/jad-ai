  "summary": "The text discusses the punishment of Edom with fire, which according to the text was sent to the generation that crucified the Savior. This fire was kindled by the Romans and will burn furiously until the depths of hell, as foretold by Moses. It mentions the fire being sent to Themam, a region of the Edomites, which is symbolically interpreted as representing the former glory of the city and temple of Jerusalem. Additionally, the text refers to the destruction of Bosrae, representing not a different city, but Edom itself, and mystically signifying Jerusalem, which was once protected by God and angels.",
