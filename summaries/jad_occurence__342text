  "summary": "The text discusses how certain historical and biblical events can be understood in three ways. It references the civil wars in Samaria as recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles, where internal conflicts occur despite a united front against Judah. Similarly, during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans, internal discord among the defenders inadvertently strengthens the external enemy's success, with divine wrath nullifying any mercy from men. The text also relates this to ecclesiastical history, highlighting persistent disputes among heretics, who, despite their disagreements, unite against the Catholic Church. The phrase 'each shall eat the flesh of his own arm' is thus interpreted in a threefold sense, symbolizing internal strife leading to destruction.",
