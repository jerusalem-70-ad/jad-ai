  "summary": "The text draws a typological parallel between the Passion of Christ, represented by Calvary, and an event involving the prophet Elisha. When Elisha ascended from Jericho to Bethel, he was mocked by children, upon which he summoned two bears to punish them. Similarly, Christ, when ascending to the house of God, was mocked and thus unleashed two bears, symbolizing either the devil and his angels or Vespasian and Titus, who destroyed those who did not repent after 42 yearsâ€”a reference to the destruction that followed Christ's resurrection.",
