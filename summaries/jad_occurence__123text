  "summary": "This text discusses the divine judgment executed against the Jewish people by the Roman Empire, as foretold. The passage refers to the Romans, led by Vespasian and Titus, as 'angels of God' who, by divine command, destroyed the murderers and burned their city. This event, occurring 42 years after Christ's resurrection, is seen as God's justice. The narrative connects to a biblical account where Jesus mentions the cup given by the Father, implying necessary suffering and sacrifice, further highlighted by Jesus healing the ear of a struck servant, as described by Luke.",
