  "summary": "This text describes significant events related to early Christianity and the Jewish people. It recounts the martyrdoms of James, the brother of Jesus, and Mark the Evangelist, noting Stephen as the first martyr. Following the death of the Apostle James, a great calamity befell the Jews, with Vespasian arriving to destroy the temple and a significant number of Jews dying by sword and famine. Domitian, second to Nero in persecuting Christians, exiled the Apostle John to Patmos and committed various acts of cruelty. After Domitian's death, John returned from exile, later living to old age until he laid himself to rest, with the Gospel suggesting he would not taste death until the Lord's return for judgment.",
