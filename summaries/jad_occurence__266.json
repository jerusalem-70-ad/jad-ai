  "summary": "The text describes a meeting of high priests and Pharisees who are concerned about Jesus performing many signs. They worry that if they do nothing, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take their place and nation. Their fear is rooted in losing temporal power rather than considering eternal life, resulting in losing both. Historical context is given about how the Romans took their place and nation after Jesusâ€™s crucifixion and glorification. This was due to the fear that if everyone believed in Christ, there would be no one left to defend the city of God and the temple against the Romans.",
