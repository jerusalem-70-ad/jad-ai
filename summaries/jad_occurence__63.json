  "summary": "The text discusses historical events related to the image of Caesar and the equestrian statue of Emperor Hadrian, both associated with the Jerusalem Temple before its destruction. Hadrian's actions, like stopping for a widow to deliver justice and ordering the construction of a new city called Aelia, which barred Jews, are highlighted. It is suggested these events foreshadow Antichrist's arrival, who will claim divinity and should be opposed. Christians who followed Gospel teachings escaped harm by leaving Jerusalem before the Roman siege, a strategy Apostles supported while still alive.",
