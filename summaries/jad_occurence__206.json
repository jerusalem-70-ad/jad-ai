  "summary": "This text provides an interpretation of Psalm 34, focusing on Christ's perspective on the judgement and defeat of the Jews. It suggests that Christ, rather than praying for the downfall of the Jews, allows it through divine judgement. The text claims that after Jesus was glorified and justified the righteous through faith, the Jews, who harmed and opposed Christ, were judged and defeated, following the destruction of the Temple and the loss of their land. Even today, the text argues, Jews are consumed by their anger, unable to bear the name of Christ, and implicitly recognizing that they lost their land because of His blood. The prayer to 'judge those who harm me' and 'fight those who fight me' is seen as a reference to the Roman emperors Titus and Vespasian, who helped fulfill these events.",
