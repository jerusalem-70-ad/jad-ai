  "summary": "The text describes a divine judgment on Jacob's pride that causes turmoil and an uprising of the Roman Empire. This leads to an anticipated woe upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fearing Roman retribution unless a significant death occurs. This fear becomes reality during a Roman siege where a large gathering of unbelievers, confident in the city's fortifications especially during Passover, are confronted with destruction.
