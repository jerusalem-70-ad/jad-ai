  "summary": "The text describes the common garments worn by priests and high priests, focusing on the linen undergarments known as 'MACHNASE' in Hebrew and 'περσκελη' in Greek. These garments, also referred to as 'feminalia' or 'bracae,' reach down to the knees. They are tightly fitted below the navel to ensure that, even if priests were to fall while performing their duties like sacrificing animals or carrying loads, their private parts would remain covered. The text references preventative measures in temple design, such as the prohibition of altar steps, to avoid exposing the priests. The account mentions that these garments, woven from strong twisted linen, were sewn after being cut, as noted by the historian Josephus.",
