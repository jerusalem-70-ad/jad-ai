  "summary": "The text describes the destruction of a city by Titus and the Roman army, where some inhabitants were killed by the sword, others were burned, and young people were taken captive. The city itself was so completely destroyed that no stone was left upon another, fulfilling a prophecy made by Ezekiel and echoed by Jesus about the city's desolation. The text reflects on why this ruin happened, pointing to the city's failure to recognize the time of its visitation by God through Jesus, who showed many signs and miracles during his incarnation.",
