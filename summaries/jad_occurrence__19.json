  "summary": "The text discusses the symbolic representation of Christ as the head of the Church, with the apostles and faithful being likened to his hair. It mentions how Christ was abandoned by his disciples during his passion, drawing a parallel to the biblical story of Elisha, who was mocked as he ascended the mountain. This mockery is likened to the Jews mocking Jesus during his crucifixion on Calvary. The text then describes how Elisha cursed the mocking children, leading to bears attacking them, which is interpreted as a symbol of Christ's vengeance. Following Christ's ascension, it is noted that 42 years later, the destruction brought by Vespasian and Titus against the Jews serves as a form of retribution for Christ's crucifixion.",
