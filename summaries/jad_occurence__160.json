  "summary": "The text discusses the interpretation of a biblical passage from Solomon about dining at the table of a powerful person, relating it to the wisdom found in Scripture. It reflects on how Scripture can become a trap for those who misinterpret it, particularly referencing the Jews during the time of Christ. The text mentions historical events, including the siege under Titus and Vespasian, as times when this misinterpretation resulted in disaster. It also reflects on Jewish resistance to the message of Christ, due to their expectation of a Messiah who remains eternally, causing scandal when Jesus died on the cross. The text suggests that this misunderstanding is part of the divine plan and punishment for past transgressions.",
