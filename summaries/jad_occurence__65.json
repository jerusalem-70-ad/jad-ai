  "summary": "The text describes a historical event where Roman forces entered Judea and punished the Jewish people with various tortures. They also set fire to the city of Jerusalem. This was seen as divine retribution for the Jews' rejection of God's invitation to attend a divine banquet. As a result, the apostles were directed to invite the Gentiles (idolaters) instead. This narrative is used allegorically to illustrate the spreading of the Gospel to the Gentiles after the Jews' refusal.",
