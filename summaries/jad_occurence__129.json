  "summary": "The text discusses the rejection of divine invitation by the Jews, as represented by God's messengers, the apostles and prophets, through both Law and Gospel. Their rejection leads to the joy of eternal life being opened to the Gentiles. God's wrath is depicted through the sending of armies and destruction of Jerusalem by Emperor Vespasian, which symbolizes divine vengeance. The man without a wedding garment represents those who rest in faith but are found unworthy due to tainted deeds, ultimately facing eternal punishment.",
