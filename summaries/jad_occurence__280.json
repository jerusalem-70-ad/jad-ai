  "summary": "The text discusses the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus Christ by those who were given the chance to kill him. It refers to his unjust death as being led like a lamb to slaughter without resistance, fulfilling divine wrath, not only in the future but also in the present life, as exemplified by the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and Judea as retribution for their deeds. The text then advises believers to remain patient until the Lord's coming, comparing it to a farmer patiently waiting for the precious fruits of the earth.",
