  "summary": "Josephus, son of Matthias and a priest from Jerusalem, was captured by Vespasian and remained with his son Titus. Coming to Rome, he presented seven books on the Jewish captivity to the emperors, which were also placed in the public library. Due to his intellectual brilliance, he was honored with a statue in Rome. Additionally, he authored twenty books on Antiquities, covering history from the world's beginning to the fourteenth year of Domitian Caesar. He also wrote against Appion, the Alexandrian grammarian, who had criticized the Jewish people. Another notable work by Josephus, addressing the Christian faith, declares that Jesus was a wise man, a performer of miracles, and a crucified teacher, believed to be the Christ. Moreover, he affirms John the Baptist as a true prophet and attributes the destruction of Jerusalem to the killing of the Apostle James.",
