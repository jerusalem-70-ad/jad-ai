  "summary": "The text reflects on the symbolism of the two wings of a hen as the two Testaments or leaders like Moses and Aaron, through whom God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian captivity, or Jesus and Zerubbabel during the Babylonian captivity. Despite these blessings, the people were ungrateful and rejected their benefactor, leading to the prophecy that their 'house will be left to them desolate', which was fulfilled when Jerusalem's Temple was destroyed by Titus and Vespasian due to their disbelief. The spiritual desolation of the Jews is emphasized, foresaw by Jeremiah, as they did not accept Christ into their hearts. The narrative links to typology regarding the desolation and spiritual rejection of the Jews.",
