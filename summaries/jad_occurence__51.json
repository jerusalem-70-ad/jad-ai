  "summary": "Vespasian ruled for nine years and was known for his military prowess. He reclaimed many provinces lost by Nero and Galba. In his second year, his son Titus captured and destroyed Jerusalem, resulting in the death of 1.1 million Jews and the selling of 100,000 into slavery. The conflict lasted four years and was partly motivated by Jewish rebellion against Roman rule and their role in condemning Jesus Christ. The Romans took sacred artifacts from the temple in Jerusalem back to Rome.",
