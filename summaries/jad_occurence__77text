  "summary": "The text discusses how the impious Jews handed over Jesus to the Romans for burial, due to their persecution up to His death. They guarded His tomb by sealing it with a stone and setting guards. Additionally, it mentions that the wealthy scribes and Pharisees, who boasted in the riches of the doctrine of the law, gave Him over to death. Another interpretation suggests that Jesus, through His death and burial, acquired impious Gentiles, who lacked piety towards God the Father, and the Jews, boasting in the riches of the law and the prophets.",
