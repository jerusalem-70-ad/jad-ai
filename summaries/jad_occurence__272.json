  "summary": "The text discusses the historical events surrounding Jerusalem, including the Jewish group that allied with Antiochus Epiphanes, leading to a persecution of the Jewish people. It mentions internal conflicts among the Jews, particularly the disputes between Hyrcanus and Alexander, which led to General Pompey's capture of Jerusalem, bringing it under Roman control. Later, the city was taken and the temple destroyed under Titus and Vespasian. Fifty years after that, under Emperor Hadrian, the city was completely burned and destroyed, losing even its original name.",
