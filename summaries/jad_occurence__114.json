  "summary": "This text emphasizes the importance of valuing time and diligence in work, drawing a comparison between pagans and Christians. It highlights how some pagans, despite not having laws or prophets, were so dedicated to their pursuits that they regretted losing a day without laboring for their kingdom. The example of Titus, son of Vespasian, is given, who lamented a lost day in which he did not contribute to the stability of his reign. The text encourages Christians, who share a common religion, devotion, and faith, to follow apostolic teachings and avoid idleness, implying that failing to do so is a greater offense given the Christian context.",
