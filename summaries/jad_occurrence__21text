  "summary": "The text is a metaphorical depiction of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, likened to the harvesting of a vineyard. The prophet refers to various synagogues of different nations surrounding Israel as 'women' who used to come and teach the Israelites how to prepare for their enemies. After the destruction, these 'women' were filled with sorrow, not because of any religious sentiment but due to the demise of such a significant city. The text also reflects on the historical instances where women, like Debbora and Orda, played prominent roles during times of crisis, which was seen as shameful by contemporary standards. The mention of women's reaction to Jerusalem's desolation further emphasizes the ignominy faced by the Israelites.",
