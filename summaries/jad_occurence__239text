  "summary": "The document outlines the themes from a collection of psalms relating to the New Testament. The first psalm describes the power and justice of a new king sent by God to the Jews. The second psalm discusses his unusual ways, criticized by some for uplifting his enemies with wealth and honor while subjecting his friends to poverty and oppression. The third psalm mentions the remarkable fairness of his judgment, noting how he punishes the wicked using other wicked people, such as the Jews being crushed by the Romans. The fourth psalm praises him for his judgments, and the fifth recalls the king's dwelling in Zion and Jerusalem.",
