  "summary": "Jesus, after leaving the temple, was approached by his disciples who showed him the temple's structures. He prophesied that not a single stone would remain intact, which historically came to pass 42 years after his crucifixion when the city and its magnificent temple were completely destroyed under the Roman leaders Vespasian and Titus. The site was leveled to the ground, and the current surrounding wall reflects this destruction, enclosing the area where Jesus was crucified outside the city gates.",
