  "summary": "The text describes a time when certain people, while still under the influence of pagan traditions, sought to conquer lands inhabited by Christian Gauls. Despite their warlike approach, they never persecuted or executed anyone for their Christian faith. In contrast to Roman severity, which punished with fire and sword, these people showed generosity by adorning those who suffered with gold, silver, gems, and amber. They honored those persecuted not only from their own lands but also from Spain, Italy, or any other countries, showing great affection and cherishing their martyrs and confessors. This devotion made them renowned and respectable, maintaining an unwavering faith that ultimately led to a triumphant victory in Jerusalem.",
