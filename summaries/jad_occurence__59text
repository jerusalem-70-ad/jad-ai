  "summary": "In this text, the Lord provides various teachings, including a parable about a man who had a barren fig tree in his vineyard for three years, finding no fruit. The man orders it to be cut down to avoid leaving it to occupy the ground fruitlessly. The barren fig tree in the vineyard symbolizes the Synagogue within the law that lacked spiritual fruits. For three periods, the Lord sought fruit from it through the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, but due to infidelity, it withered, and judgment was cast upon it by the Romans' sword. It also represents any person in the Church who lacks good deeds. The fruit of faith is demanded, and without a confession, repentance, and goodwill, the person will be cut down and cast into hellfire.",
