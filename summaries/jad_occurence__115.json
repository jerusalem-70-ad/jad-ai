  "summary": "During the time of Joacim, his son did not succeed him as king, unlike Joacim who followed his father. Instead, there was captivity and neither Salathiel nor Zorobabel, nor anyone until Christ, held royal power. This was foretold in Hebrew as 'In his days and at that time,' implying that no man would sit on David's throne during this period. Consequently, all were captives, and from the lineage of David, no one ruled in Judea thereafter. Josephus mentions that leaders were from the priestly tribe of Levi, succeeded by Herod, son of Antipater the proselyte, and eventually under Vespasian, even the semblance of such authority was utterly destroyed.",
