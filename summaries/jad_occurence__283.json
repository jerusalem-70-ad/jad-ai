  "summary": "This text discusses the notion of divine punishment upon the Jews following their refusal to believe in Christ after His passion. The punishment is described as the divine retribution carried out by the Romans. This punishment, brought upon them for not repenting, included famine, pestilence, sword, and captivity, and is suggested to last until the end of the world. The narrative implies that this temporal punishment precedes eternal judgment.",
