  "summary": "The text discusses how the Savior (Christ) withdrew His presence from the Jewish people, including the city and temple, as they were about to face destruction, showing neither favor to their enemies nor assistance to His own relatives. It compares this to Davidâ€™s absence during the battle between the Philistines and Israel, where neither side had his support. It highlights Christ's sorrow over Jerusalem, grieving for its impending ruin which He foresaw and wept over. This grief extended through His Apostle, who expressed continuous sorrow and pain of heart, witnessing the devastation of his people.",
