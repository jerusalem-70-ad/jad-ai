  "summary": "The text is a plea for divine intervention against the pride of the enemies, specifically the Roman soldiers who overthrew the holy city. It calls for God's power to be exercised to end their dominance, causing some to be defeated and others to turn away from malice and embrace humility in Christ. The text notes that this has partially been fulfilled as some Romans recognized Christ while others perished in their stubbornness, with both outcomes documented in church history.",
