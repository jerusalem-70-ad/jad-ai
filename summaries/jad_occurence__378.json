  "summary": "The text discusses the analogy between biblical figures and spiritual concepts. Paul is portrayed as the 'son of oil' or wisdom due to his role in enlightening the Church, similar to how the prophet Elisha was anointed by Elijah, symbolizing Christ, to prophesy. Elisha's condemnation of Jewish children, leading to their demise by bears, is compared to Paul's criticism of Jewish legal observance, resulting in the devastation of Judea by Titus and Vespasian. Elisha filling vessels with oil parallels Paul's role in filling the hearts of the Gentiles with divine knowledge. Both figures are characterized as 'sons of oil' for their spiritual joy and faithful stewardship of the Church.",
