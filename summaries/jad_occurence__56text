  "summary": "The text discusses the prophecy that when Jerusalem is surrounded by armies, those in Judea should flee to the mountains. This refers to a historical event where the faithful in Judea fled to Pella upon the arrival of the Romans, as narrated in Ecclesiastical History, following an angelic warning. The text also addresses the instruction to pray that the flight does not occur in winter or on the Sabbath, noting that the land is more suitable for fleeing in winter than in the heat of summer. The restriction on traveling over a thousand steps on the Sabbath according to the law is mentioned, although Jesus had already ended the observance of the Sabbath, suggesting a mysterious meaning to the instructions.",
