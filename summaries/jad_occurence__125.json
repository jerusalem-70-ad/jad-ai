  "summary": "The text uses metaphor to teach that from leaders to the common people, and from scholars to the uneducated masses, there is no health, as all consent with equal fervor in impiety. The phrase 'there is no health in him' refers to the extreme captivity after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian, and later by Emperor Hadrian. Until the present time, there is no remedy, fulfilling the scripture: 'All have turned aside, together they have become worthless; there is none who does good, not even one' (Psalm XIII). This lack of health can be understood in the people, the body, or the head.",
