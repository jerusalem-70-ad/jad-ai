After they crucified Jesus, the Roman army overtook them, leading to their significant loss and the deprivation of their kingdom and homeland. This is interpreted as divine retribution, as predicted by the prophet, and is further emphasized by the words of Stephen, the first martyr, who accused them of resisting the Holy Spirit.",
