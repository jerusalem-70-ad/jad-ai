  "summary": "The text reflects on the suffering and captivity of a people, attributed to idolatry, particularly during their capture in Babylon, and compares it to the harsher captivity under Titus and Vespasian. It suggests that the divine patience allowed time for repentance, but accumulated wrath led to severe consequences. Analogously, the celestial church of Christ, despite being predestined for glory, suffers in the present life due to ignorance and blindness. The allegory suggests a spiritual struggle within the church, anticipating greater glory amidst earthly adversities.",
