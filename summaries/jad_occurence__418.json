  "summary": "The psalm is titled 'In finem intellectus Asaph,' which translates to 'To the end of understanding Asaph.' It is termed 'intellectus' because it elucidates a deeply obscure matter, namely the future destruction of God's temple and city by Titus and Vespasian, an event not yet occurred during the prophet's time. Asaph, meaning 'congregation,' symbolizes the faithful synagogues. The content represents the Synagogue lamenting and mourning the anticipated destruction. The psalm's structure includes three parts: the first part is a lamentation about the people's destruction and a prayer for God's mercy, with acknowledgment of the Jews' own merits leading to this. The second part begins with 'Deus autem rex noster,' praying for God's miraculous mercy towards the Jews as shown to the world. The third part, starting with 'Ne tradas bestiis,' is a plea for God to have mercy at least on the poor and those who confess Him, regardless of what happens to others. The intention is to encourage empathy for the suffering of others, as part of charity, reflected in the Apostle's words: 'Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.'",
