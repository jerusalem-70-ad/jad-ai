  "summary": "The text discusses the idea that God intervenes in the actions of the Jewish people with regard to the death of Christ. It uses metaphors of racing and wrestling to describe how God 'pre-empts' the Jewish plans by resurrecting Jesus. The text also talks about God dividing and punishing the Jews, referring to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian as a divine act. The division is seen as just due to the sins of the Jewish people being 'hidden' from God in terms of execution, not knowledge.",
