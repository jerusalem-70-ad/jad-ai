  "summary": "The text critiques those who believe that after the passion of Christ, the Law must still be followed, referring to such groups as Ebionites and their allies. It argues that sacrifices and offerings were not primarily desired by God but were to prevent idolatry and to transition from physical to spiritual sacrifices. The text suggests that the spiritual law is fulfilled through spiritual practices, not physical ones. It also references the reconstruction of the Temple after the Babylonian destruction and speaks of the final destruction under Vespasian and Titus, indicating it will last until the end of the world. Concerning festivals and gatherings, it states that without spiritual sacrifice, they are detestable to God.",
