  "summary": "The text interprets the words of Jesus regarding his departure and the inability of people to apprehend him or find him afterwards. It elaborates on the future seeking of Jesus either for assistance during the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, through repentance and spiritual longing, or by those with harmful intentions. However, these attempts will be unsuccessful as he will no longer be physically present. Jesus will be ascended to heaven, preparing a place for his followers, highlighting a spiritual rather than a physical presence after resurrection.",
