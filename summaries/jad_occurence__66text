  "summary": "The text discusses a parable of a barren fig tree in a vineyard that represents the Synagogue, which was unfruitful under the law as taught by patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. Because it did not produce good works, it was metaphorically cut down by God's judgment through the Romans. The barren fig tree also symbolizes a person in the church without good deeds, who, if not repentance through confession, will face spiritual death and punishment.",
