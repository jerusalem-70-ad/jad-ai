  "summary": "The text discusses the interpretation of a biblical prophecy about the 'abomination of desolation' mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in a holy place, as referenced in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The text suggests that understanding this prophecy requires careful comparison of these Gospel accounts. Matthew and Mark mention fleeing to the mountains during this event, especially for those in Judaea. Luke, however, explicitly links it to the Roman siege of Jerusalem. The text aims to uncover the deeper mystical understanding behind these biblical passages.",
