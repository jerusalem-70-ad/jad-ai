I'm sorry, but it appears there's not enough context in "inimici tui vallo tytus et vaspasianus" to provide a detailed summary or identify keywords from the list provided. This phrase seems like a fragment and might be referring to historical figures possibly linked to the Roman siege or conquest of Jerusalem post-Christ, specifically Titus and Vespasian. Could you provide more information or context?
