  "summary": "The text discusses a historical interpretation about the division of a prophetic timeline involving Jerusalem's fate, suggesting that a certain prophetic week is split between the reign of Vespasian and Hadrian. The Jewish historian Josephus recorded that Vespasian and Titus maintained peace with the Jews for three years and six months, while the remaining time coincided with Hadrian's time, when Jerusalem was completely destroyed. The Hebrew perspective does not focus on the chronological span from the first year of Darius, king of Persia, to the ultimate fall of Jerusalem under Hadrian, which they suggest covers 172 Olympiads or 696 years. This tally translates to 99 Hebrew weeks and 3 additional years, recalling the defeat of Corbas, the leader of the Jews, and the total destruction of Jerusalem.",
