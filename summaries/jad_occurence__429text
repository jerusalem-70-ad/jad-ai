  "summary": "The prophet predicts the cessation of anointment with the coming of Christ, as foretold by Daniel. This text suggests that the Jewish people, who promised to follow God's commandments, would fail, leading to a lack of spiritual fruits (faith or good works). The earthly Jerusalem is described as losing its prominence, with Jewish people and religious leaders no longer producing spiritual fruit, symbolized by the absence of livestock and fields bearing food. The destruction and loss of dignity in Jerusalem aligns with divine prophecy, leaving the city desolate. In contrast, the prophet and all the saints find joy in God, specifically in Jesus as the savior. This reflects a shift from earthly glory to spiritual joy in salvation. The use of the Hebrew name 'Jesus' is emphasized as it holds joy and sweetness.",
