  "summary": "The passage describes a prophecy about the Roman conquest of Jerusalem, wherein the Roman army will be compared to countless grains of sand, symbolizing their overwhelming numbers. It predicts that during a time of peace, sudden wars will arise under Emperor Nero, leading to the visitation of Jerusalem by the 'Lord of Hosts' with thunder, earthquakes, and consuming fire, symbolizing the burning of the temple. The Romans, having conquered the Jews and overthrown Jerusalem under Titus and Vespasian, took the treasures of Godâ€™s house to the Capitol. They attributed their success to their power and the favor of the gods, rather than the wrath of God. However, much like a hungry man dreaming of eating or a thirsty man dreaming of drinking, who remain unfulfilled upon waking, so too will those who fight against Zion and acquire riches under Roman power eventually leave empty-handed.",
