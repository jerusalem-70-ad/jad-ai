  "summary": "The text discusses the spiritual decline from the new law of Christ, touching on the conflict between Paul and Peter regarding adherence to old Jewish laws. It mentions the casting out of those who continued circumcision, likening them to eating from the tree of knowledge, bringing a divine curse, and their dispersion by Roman generals Titus and Vespasian. The Jews are allowed to continue their rituals until they convert at the end of times. This is linked to temporal correspondences between creation and grace, highlighting notable biblical events such as the building of Noah's ark, the appearance of the rainbow, and the division of languages. The text emphasizes the symbolic significance of these events in relation to salvation.",
