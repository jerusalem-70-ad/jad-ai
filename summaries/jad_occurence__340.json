  "summary": "The text discusses the fall of Jerusalem's leaders due to the destructive power of their tongues, likened to a sharp sword. It references biblical psalms that depict the fury of spoken words as deadly weapons. This resulted in the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary's soul being pierced as foretold by Simeon. The fall of these leaders came from their own people's treachery and the Roman conquest, as described by Josephus, marking a loss from which they could not recover. This downfall is attributed to their enduring sinfulness, rooted in their history since the time of their origin in Egypt.",
