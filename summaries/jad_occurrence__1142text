I'm sorry, but without additional context or more text on "postquam redierunt romani ipsa eversa iudei", I can't provide a detailed summary or identify appropriate keywords. However, if the text is related to historical events involving Roman actions against the Jewish people or Jerusalem, common themes might involve Jewish Revolts, the destruction of the Temple, or Roman persecution. Please provide more text or context for a comprehensive summary.
