  "summary": "The text describes how a powerful ruler, with his countless armies, punished a city of murderers by setting it on fire. These armies, seen as agents of divine retribution, could be interpreted as angels of vengeance or the Roman forces led by Vespasian and Titus. The destruction of Jerusalem is attributed to their actions, particularly following events like the stoning of Stephen, and deaths of James and James Alphaeus. The Roman army is described as the instrument of God's justice, as it would not have come to the city unless summoned by the Lord, as frequently mentioned in the prophets.",
