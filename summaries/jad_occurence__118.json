  "summary": "The text discusses the extreme hardships faced by the Jewish people, highlighting an instance where women, due to severe famine, resorted to eating their own children. It references a biblical event during the siege of Samaria, where a woman cooked and ate her son out of desperation, and expected the same of her neighbor's son. Similarly, during the Roman siege under Titus and Vespasian, a noblewoman named Maria from beyond the Jordan, driven by hunger, killed her own nursing son, ate part of him, and saved the rest for later consumption.",
