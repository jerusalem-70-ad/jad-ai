  "summary": "The text describes the punishment that will befall the leaders of Israel due to their wicked actions, such as robbing and killing the poor. It suggests that they will cry out to the Lord, but He will not listen to them, and He will hide His face from them due to their evil deeds. Their cruelty is compared to that of lions or thieves, as they have oppressed the innocent in Jerusalem. This punishment is suggested to occur during the Babylonian or Roman conquests.",
