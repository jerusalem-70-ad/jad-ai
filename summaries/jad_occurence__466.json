  "summary": "The text describes a period given to the Jewish people for repentance until the 42nd year. Despite this, they continued in malice, leading to Vespasian and Titus, likened to bears from Roman nations, causing destruction and mockery of the Jewish people. Jerusalem subsequently lost its sanctity and was spiritually named Sodom and Egypt. A new city would be established, bringing joy and healing. In this new era, the believing crowd in Christ observes the growth of the Church, as foretold in Isaiah, while Israel mourns the loss of the Temple.",
