  "summary": "The text discusses a divine warning from the book of Isaiah that God will not listen to those with blood-stained hands. It describes the downfall of a city, built on injustices, where justice has been dormant. The city, not built by the Lord of hosts, suffered great calamities during the time when Vespasian and Titus surrounded it with armies. Many people perished due to hunger and siege, leading up to the final ruin under Emperor Hadrian. The destruction of the city and its people, including those who came to help, resulted in the spread of Christ's glory throughout the earth, covering the world with His teachings as waters cover the sea.",
