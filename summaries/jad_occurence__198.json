  "summary": "The text discusses a passage from the prophet Jeremiah which is set against those who surrounded the Lord, particularly focusing on the plot of the Pharisees and priests to kill Him, as they feared losing their place and nation to the Romans. The passage calls for God to bring affliction upon them, which historically occurred through Titus and Vespasian when both the kingdom and the nation were lost. The passage refers to the numerous attempts by the Jews to kill the Lord, such as trying to stone Him and send ministers to apprehend Him. The evangelist aptly commented that from that day on, they plotted to kill Him.",
