  "summary": "The text discusses a prophecy about a great calamity and destruction coming to Jerusalem, as expressed in the words about enemies surrounding the city and leaving no stone unturned. It highlights a dialogue where women of Jerusalem are urged to weep for themselves rather than for the prophesied suffering. This foretells the terrible events brought upon the Jewish people by Roman leaders Vespasian and Titus, leading to their death and captivity. The text suggests that these events served as divine retribution for the spilling of sacred blood, with the judgment upon the Jewish people coming first spiritually by the Church before being realized physically by Roman forces.",
