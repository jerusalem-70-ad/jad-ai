  "summary": "The text discusses God's proclamation of a consuming fire against those who cannot stand or resist in the context of divine judgment, as depicted in the Song of Deuteronomy. It emphasizes that none can withstand this wrath, but those who do not stand or resist might be spared. This theme is likened to the historical event of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. Prior to this event, Christians were warned by prophecy to flee the impending Roman-Jewish war, relocating temporarily to the city of Pella under the protection of King Agrippa, as recorded in church history and referenced in Acts of the Apostles.",
