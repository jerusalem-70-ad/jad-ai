  "summary": "The text discusses the event of Pentecost where the apostles began to speak in different tongues, symbolizing the unity of languages that the Church seeks to restore after the dispersion of languages from the Tower of Babel. This diversity in languages also metaphorically represents different spiritual gifts. The Holy Spirit's impartation of the gift of tongues highlights the ease with which divine wisdom can teach and transform individuals. The text also considers the presence of Jewish people living in Jerusalem after captivity, questioning their origins. The captivity under Antiochus is proposed as the most recent and relevant context, compared to those in Egypt and Babylon which were already resolved.",
