  "summary": "The text is a reflection on the spiritual decline worsened by heresy and schismatics, compared to past devastations like the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. It condemns those who harm the Church not by physical violence, but through misleading doctrine and divisive actions. These actions are compared to the brutal actions of Roman emperors Titus and Vespasian against Jerusalem. Asaph's song is a plea for judgement on those attacking the Church and a hope for mercy on those persecuted for their faith.",
