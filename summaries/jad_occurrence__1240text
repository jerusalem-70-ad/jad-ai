I'm sorry, without more context it's not clear what specific text you are referring to. Typically, "videns civitatem flevit super illiam" translates from Latin to "seeing the city, he wept over it," which is a reference to a scene from the Bible where Jesus weeps over Jerusalem. If you have a specific text in mind, please provide more details or key excerpts.
