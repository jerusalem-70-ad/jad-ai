  "summary": "The homily reflects on the Gospel passage where Jesus weeps over Jerusalem, predicting its downfall due to the people's failure to recognize their time of visitation. This downfall is linked to the historical destruction of Jerusalem by Roman emperors Vespasian and Titus. The homily draws an analogy between the city's destruction and the moral ruin of individuals who do not heed God's visitations through teachings, trials, and miracles. The homily also likens this to the cleansing of the Temple, emphasizing spiritual vigilance and the rejection of corruption within the soul and the community of believers. A notable story highlights the value of compassion, as seen in the miraculous encounter of a monk carrying a leper who is revealed to be Christ. This story underscores the belief that acts of compassion toward the disregarded are acts of service to Christ himself.",
