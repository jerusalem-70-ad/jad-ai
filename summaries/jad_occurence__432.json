  "summary": "After thirteen years of rule, Roman Emperor Nero dies. Galba and Otho briefly seize power before Vespasian, positioned with his army in Judea, is summoned back and given the empire. His son Titus is entrusted with the campaign against Jerusalem, leading to the city's fall and destruction. As Jerusalem faces its ruin, an astonishing famine strikes, resulting in severe internal conflict among Jews. A grim tale is recounted of a woman named Mary, who, driven by famine, cooks and consumes her own child. The city of Jerusalem, assaulted and captured by Rome, suffers immense death tolls and widespread destruction, with 1.1 million said to be killed by sword and starvation. Survivors face further punishment, including enslavement. This siege is perceived as divine wrath particularly during the Jewish Passover, underscoring the notion of retribution for the crucifixion of Christ on Passover decades prior. The text concludes with signs believed to foretell the city's doom, occurring forty years after Christ's crucifixion, which should have served as warnings for repentance.",
