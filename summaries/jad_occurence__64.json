  "summary": "The text discusses a king's wrath upon discovering that his servants were murdered, leading him to send armies to destroy the murderers and burn their city. This act is metaphorically interpreted as God using evil angels or Romans under Vespasian and Titus to punish the Jews and burn the city. Alternatively, it suggests God will use holy angels for judgment, destroying those who persecute and burning the body in hell along with the soul.",
