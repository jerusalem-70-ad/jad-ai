  "summary": "The text discusses the anger of a king, who initially invited all people to his feast, signifying his mercy. However, when vengeance is mentioned, he sends his army to destroy murderers and set their city on fire. This is interpreted as a reference to the Jews, who killed the prophets (e.g., apostles, John, James, Stephen) sent by God. Subsequently, God's army, symbolized by Vespasian and Titus, justly exacted revenge by destroying the murderers and burning the grand temple, leading to the eventual destruction of the city by the Romans.",
