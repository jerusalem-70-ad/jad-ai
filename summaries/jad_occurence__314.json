  "summary": "The text discusses a prophecy regarding the opening of hope after the destruction of the Jewish Synagogue and the city of Jerusalem by the Romans. It draws a parallel between the historical account of Achor's death, which gave the Israelites hope for victory, and the fall of Jerusalem, which opened the way for the apostles to spread the faith of Christ worldwide. It identifies Judas Iscariot from the tribe of Judah as analogous to Achor and his betrayal of Christ, alongside the scheming scribes and Pharisees, as part of this prophetic and historical narrative.",
