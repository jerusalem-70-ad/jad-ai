  "summary": "The passage discusses the idea that those who were misled, specifically the Jewish people who were convinced by the religious leaders to demand the crucifixion of Jesus, were not exempt from punishment. According to the Psalmist, they would be handed over to the sword and their souls to evil spirits, as prophesied. The Romans fulfilled this prophecy by literally taking them by the sword. It highlights a Biblical interpretation of their fate using militant imagery and attributing it to divine retribution.",
