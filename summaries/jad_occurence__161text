  "summary": "The text is a theological reflection on the Christian symbolism of the cross, referred to as the 'tree of apple.' It explains the significance of the cross as a source of redemption for Israel (the Synagogue), drawing parallels between the crucifixion of Christ and the redemption of humanity. The text uses allegories of the Sunamitis sleeping under the tree, representing the synagogue's fall and Christ raising her, symbolizing his sacrificial death on the cross for redemption. There is an emphasis on love and commitment, urging believers to keep Christ's memory alive in their hearts and actions. The document also references the consequences faced by Jewish people historically for the crucifixion, and how the Church honored this through martyrdom during persecutions.",
