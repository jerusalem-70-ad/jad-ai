  "summary": "The text discusses the decision of the Jews, influenced by a malevolent force, to release the seditious Barabbas and demand the crucifixion of Jesus. This led to the loss of peace in their world, as they suffered from ongoing discord and conflict after choosing Barabbas, an embodiment of sedition, over the 'Prince of Peace'. It suggests that this decision resulted in a long-lasting persecution, symbolized by a 'great sword'. The destruction of Jerusalem under Titus and Vespasian is highlighted as an example of the consequences of these actions, and the deplorable event is linked to the apocalyptic vision of ongoing conflict and the persecution of saints as represented by the Babylonian Whore.",
