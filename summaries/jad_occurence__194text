  "summary": "The text discusses the metaphor of moving mountains, representing the apostles being led from Jews to Gentiles, and how the Jews were unaware of the grace they lost. It highlights the destruction of Judea by the likes of Titus and Vespasian, with priests and teachers of law being unable to live in their land. It further describes God turning away the illuminating life of the preachers from the Jews, whose light was sealed away to be returned at a later time.",
