I'm sorry, but the text you provided seems to be just a Latin phrase: "ad litteram evenerunt tempore titi et vespasiani," which translates to "literally happened in the time of Titus and Vespasian." There's not much context or content to create a detailed summary from this alone. However, I can provide relevant keywords based on the likely historical context.

{
  "summary": "Events literally occurred during the times of the Roman Emperors Titus and Vespasian.",
  "keywords": ["Fulfillment prophecy", "Jerusalem's conquest 1099", "Destruction Gaza and Ascalon"]
}
