  "summary": "The text discusses the Christian typological interpretation of Samson's story in which his hair was cut by the Philistines. It compares this to the struggle of the Son of God against visible and invisible enemies. Nobody, neither angels nor humans, helped Him; He fought and prevailed alone. This is paralleled by a passage where God declares He has trampled His enemies in anger. The text interprets this as Jesus defeating both Jews and demons, stripping the latter of their worldly power and the former of their place, nation, priesthood, temple, and dignity through the Romans. Furthermore, it describes Jesus' blood being shed as a decision made by demons and executed by the Jews and soldiers.",
