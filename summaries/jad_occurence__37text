  "summary": "The text discusses a prophecy by David, which predicts two outcomes for a certain group. One part is destined for destruction, while the other is to be elevated. The text laments the neglect of a vineyard, which represents a divine responsibility that was not maintained, leading to its destruction by a wild boar from the forest, symbolizing the Roman army led by Titus and Vespasian. The Roman forces were sent to punish the wicked caretakers of the vineyard, who not only failed to cultivate it for God's glory but also separated themselves from the true vine and attempted to destroy those maintaining faith.",
