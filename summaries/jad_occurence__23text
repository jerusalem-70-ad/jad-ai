  "summary": "The passage discusses the interpretation of 'the sea' not just as the body of water adjacent to the Promised Land, but also all the nearby rivers that Jewish people used for navigation and trade. Those in ships, negotiating the seas and rivers, faced the 'day of the Lord's vengeance' as described by Josephus when the Romans arrived. This vengeance extended to the temple, which was of great beauty, and to everything deemed beautiful and delightful to behold, including virgins and young people, marking the destruction and devastation of all that was good among the people.",
