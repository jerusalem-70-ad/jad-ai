  "summary": "This text interprets a prophecy about the destruction of the temple, metaphorically referred to as 'Libanus', which was built from the cedars of Libanus, predicting its ruin by Roman leaders Vespasian and Titus. The opening of Libanus' gates symbolizes allowing enemy entrance, and the fire devouring the cedars represents the devastation of Jewish leaders, priests, and people. The lamentation of priests, leaders, and people over their destruction is emphasized, referring to the 'mighty being ravaged' and 'the fortified forest being cut down.' Basan symbolizes confusion, and the destruction of the fortified forest is a metaphor for the Roman destruction of the temple built by various kings, ultimately by Herod.",
