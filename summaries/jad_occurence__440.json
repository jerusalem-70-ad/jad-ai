  "summary": "The text describes how the captivity of Jerusalem will suddenly be visited by the Lord of Hosts, either directly from heaven or by His permission. It discusses the historical event when the Romans, initially at peace with the Jews, broke the treaty due to non-payment of tributes by the Jews. Consequently, the Roman Emperor sent his generals, Vespasian and Titus, to destroy the city. The visitation is characterized by thunderstorms, great commotion, earthquakes, and celestial voices. It suggests that not only were humans against the Jews, but all elements were opposing them. Additionally, it can also refer to the Romans' overwhelming attack, likened to a great storm, which included setting fires that consumed the temple and the city.",
