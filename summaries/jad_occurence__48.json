  "summary": "The text describes the historical evolution of the name and significance of Jerusalem. Initially called Iebus, then Salem, it eventually became known as Hierusalem, derived from these previous names. It was also referred to as Solyma, Luza, and Bethel. Ultimately, it was named Helya by Roman questor Helio after being reconstructed following its destruction by Titus and Vespasian. The text also mentions James the Apostle as the first bishop of Jerusalem, who became a martyr. After his time, Jerusalem's bishops until the reign of Emperor Justinian were of simple standing without elevated distinctions.",
