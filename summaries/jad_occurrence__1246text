I'm sorry, I cannot provide a summary of the phrase "videns civitatem flevit super illam" alone as it lacks context and sufficient information. However, I can interpret the phrase: it translates from Latin to "seeing the city, he wept over it," which is typically associated with Christ lamenting over Jerusalem. If there is a larger text associated with it, please provide more context or details for a comprehensive summary and relevant keywords. 

Based on the given options, the relevant keywords might include "Christ cleansing Temple," "Another conquest of Jerusalem," and "Spiritual exegesis" given the context of Jesus lamenting over the city's future destruction or conquest. 

Here is an example JSON output based on this interpretation:

{
  "summary": "The phrase 'videns civitatem flevit super illam' describes Jesus lamenting over Jerusalem, potentially in the context of its impending destruction or spiritual decline.",
  "keywords": ["Christ cleansing Temple", "Another conquest of Jerusalem", "Spiritual exegesis"]
}
