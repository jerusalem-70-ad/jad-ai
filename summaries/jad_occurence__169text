  "summary": "The text discusses a plea to God for help in the form of divine intervention, specifically through a metaphorical use of arms against enemies. This intervention is symbolically represented by the Roman forces, led by Titus and Vespasian, who played a role in the destruction of the Jewish population. The author interprets this as God's way of supporting a conquest over those who persecuted, particularly reflected in the siege of Jerusalem during a Passover festival, considered an act of divine justice, likened to their actions against Christ.",
