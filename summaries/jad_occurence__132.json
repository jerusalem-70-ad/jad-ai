  "summary": "In year 73 AD, Jerusalem was captured by Titus, resulting in substantial bloodshed among his troops and the destruction of the city. According to Cornelius and Suetonius, 600,000 Jews were killed. However, Josephus, a Jewish historian who was involved in the conflict, claims that 1.1 million perished from starvation and war, and 100,000 were publicly sold into slavery. This large number of people in Jerusalem was attributed to the Passover festival, which had drawn Jews from all over to the temple, thus effectively trapping them in the city. The timing of their deaths was said to coincide with the same days during which Jesus was crucified. This event occurred in the second year of Emperor Vespasian's reign, marking the final destruction of Jerusalem since the beginning of the evangelical preaching, and it took place 42 years after the rule of Tiberius Caesar and 200 years after the oppression by Antiochus. The recount spans significant periods from the second year of Darius, when the temple was rebuilt, to the original construction under Solomon, a period of 1,102 years.",
