  "summary": "The text discusses the expulsion of the servant's son to prevent him from playing with Isaac, symbolizing the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, and the scattering of its people into captivity as a result of their persecution of Christ and his followers. This event, which took place under the Roman emperors Vespasian and Titus, served to prevent the old synagogue from opposing the new Church, despite its current arrogance in claiming primacy. The son of the servant suffered expulsion for mocking Christ, the son of the free woman, and for persecuting his followers.",
