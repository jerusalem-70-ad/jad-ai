  "summary": "The text describes a message to the Jewish people through the preachers of the Gospel, questioning why they listen to the words of the scribes and Pharisees, who claim that Jesus seeks their harm. It highlights the miraculous signs that occurred during Jesus' passion, which should have been a clear indication of his divine power. Among these signs were Jesus' ability to cause an entire armed group to fall with a simple reply, and the supernatural events that followed his crucifixion, such as midday darkness, an earthquake, the splitting of rocks, and the resurrection of many dead.",
