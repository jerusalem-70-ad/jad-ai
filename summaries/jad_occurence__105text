  "summary": "The text describes a time of chaos and disorder when people will turn against each other, with young men rebelling against the elderly and the ignoble against the noble, as described in a prophetic context. This disorder is related to a historical event under Titus, the son of Vespasian, as documented by Josephus, where the Jewish people faced internal conflicts during the Roman siege, dividing Jerusalem into three factions. The prophecy echoes the New Testament's warning that mutual destruction arises from internal strife.",
