  "summary": "The text describes how Helena, motivated by her love for the Holy Cross, traveled to Jerusalem and asked the Jews to show her the location of Calvary, which was covered by dense thickets and unknown. After 40 years had passed since Christ's Passion, Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans and a new city was built by Emperor Hadrian, named Aelia Capitolina. The site of Christ's crucifixion and burial, located outside the gate, is now visible to everyone in modern-day Jerusalem.",
