{"summary":"The text discusses the divine punishment inflicted as a result of provocation and irritation, symbolized by a consuming fire in God's wrath. It references the historical destruction caused by the Romans, where the holy city of Zion (Jerusalem) was laid to waste, leaving the sacred places desolate and the inhabitants afflicted by death and captivity. The fire of retribution initiates temporal judgment, which transitions into eternal torment for those judged. A question is raised whether God imposes a double judgment or if there exists a recurring tribulation, suggesting a deeper theological reflection on divine justice.","keywords":["Vengeance","Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem","Apocalypticism"]}
