St. Jerome notes the irony that those who once bought the blood of Christ now have to purchase their own tears. There's a portrayal of the miserable condition of the Jews, expressed through their fasting and mourning. These actions are reminiscent of their past suffering during the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem.","keywords":["Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem","Anti-Judaism","Vengeance"]}
