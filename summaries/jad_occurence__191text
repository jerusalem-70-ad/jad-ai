These animals are identified as Vespasian and his son Titus, coming from Rome, a place depicted as full of errors and wild men. Their arrival instills fear and brings about punishment for the past actions against prophets and wise men. This alludes to historical events where Jerusalem faced destruction as a divine retribution for rejecting and persecuting these figures.",
