The text reflects on the desolation following the Roman destruction under Vespasian, Titus, and Hadrian, describing the absence of a future captivity and urging lament for having denied the Lord. It compares the land of Judah to a once fertile vineyard now overcome by thorns and weeds due to Roman destruction, highlighting the sorrow for a once joyful place.
