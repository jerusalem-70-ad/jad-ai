  "summary": "The text reflects on the moment when Jesus weeps over Jerusalem as he foresees its future destruction by the Romans under Vespasian and Titus. It discusses Jesus' lamentation, stating that if Jerusalem had recognized what was coming, it would have wept too. Due to its indulgence in pleasures and oblivion to looming threats, the city is unaware of the impending danger. Jesus prophesizes that enemies will build a wall around it, besiege it, and ultimately, it will be demolished, leaving nothing intact. The text highlights the fulfillment of this prophecy as the city's past structures were eradicated.",
