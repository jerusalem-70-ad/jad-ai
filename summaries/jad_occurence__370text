  "summary": "The text discusses betrayal and the impact of being deceived by someone trusted, who shared the same teachings and meals. The narrator feels targeted, sentenced to death by enemies, and pleads for mercy and resurrection from the Lord. They seek justice, either by converting enemies or judging them, drawing parallels to a historic retribution when certain enemies were defeated. The author believes their obedience and sacrifice are pleasing to God, and hopes that their enemies' joy over their downfall will be short-lived, while they themselves find joy.",
