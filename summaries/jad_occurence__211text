  "summary": "The text discusses the son of the high priest Onias who, after the death of his father, was left as a young boy. Upon observing that his uncle Menelaus was killed by the king and the priesthood was given to Alcimus, not of the priestly lineage, Onias fled to King Ptolemy of Egypt. In Egypt, Onias gained favor with King Ptolemy and his wife Cleopatra, and requested to build a temple similar to that of Jerusalem in the region of Eliopolis. This temple existed for 250 years until the reign of Emperor Vespasian. The city, later called Onias, was destroyed during the Jewish revolt against the Romans, with no remains of the city or temple left.",
